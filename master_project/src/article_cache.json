            "body": "Critics of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are eyeing his record in Florida as a harbinger of what's to come for federal transparency if he wins in 2024.Justine Goode; NBC News / Getty Images\n\nAs Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis campaigns for the White House, government accountability watchdogs are pointing to the long shadow of secrecy cast by his administration.\n\nIn the four years since DeSantis took office, his administration has routinely stonewalled the release of public records, approved a slew of new legal exceptions aimed at keeping more information out of the public eye, and waged legal battles against open government advocates, the press and other watchdogs.\n\nDeSantis, a Harvard-educated lawyer and former U.S. attorney, is the only Florida governor known to use \"executive privilege\" to keep records hidden, transparency advocates and experts said.\n\nHis travel records, previously under scrutiny by the media, are now secret, thanks to a new legal exemption -- one of a record number created in 2023 by the Republican-led Legislature and approved by the governor.\n\nDeSantis also has fought to conceal information about some of the most significant events during his tenure, including withholding Covid infection data and blocking release of records about the controversial relocation of dozens of migrants to Martha's Vineyard, legal filings show.\n\nIt's difficult to compare DeSantis to past Florida governors on transparency issues -- in part because his administration has withheld some key information sought by NBC News and other media organizations that would show how often it denies requests for records and how long it takes to disclose them.\n\nStill, DeSantis' transparency track record has alarmed open government advocates, particularly since he could carry the same ethos into the White House, if he's victorious in 2024.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" Michael Barfield, director of public access for the Florida Center for Government Accountability, a nonprofit open government watchdog. \"It's stunning, the amount of material that has been taken off the table from a state that many have considered to be the most transparent. We've quickly become one of the least transparent in the space of four years.\"\n\nBarfield called the DeSantis administration the least transparent \"of all that I've witnessed in the nearly 35 years I've been doing transparency work in Florida.\"\n\nDeSantis, a fierce media critic who typically avoids mainstream reporters, declined NBC News' requests for an interview to discuss his record on transparency issues for this story and did not respond to written questions.\n\nAdam Marshall, a lawyer for the national nonprofit Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press, said transparency in Florida had fallen before DeSantis, but that \"decrease is now accelerating.\" He added that transparency at the federal level is already bad and likely would not improve under a DeSantis presidency. \"Could it get much worse? Yes,\" he said.\n\nFlorida has long had a reputation for government transparency, boasting some of the nation's broadest public records and open meetings laws. In 1992, Floridians overwhelmingly approved an amendment to enshrine citizens' access to public records and open meetings as rights in the state's constitution -- the first state to do so.\n\nSuch rights include access to records held by the state's governor. Only Florida's Legislature is constitutionally authorized to make exceptions to the state's Public Records Act, as long as it can justify each exemption as a \"public necessity\" and make it \"no broader than necessary.\"\n\nSince taking office in 2019, DeSantis has repeatedly tested the letter and spirit of Florida's sunshine laws and constitutional guarantees, sometimes bypassing the Legislature in novel ways, experts say.\n\nIn legal filings, lawyers for the governor have contended DeSantis can exercise executive privilege to withhold records at his discretion, although such an exemption isn't cited in the state's laws or its constitution.\n\nIn a January ruling on one of those lawsuits -- a case involving an anonymous requester who sought the names of DeSantis' advisers for deciding his picks for the state supreme court -- a Leon County judge agreed he could invoke the authority. The ruling -- a first in DeSantis' favor on the issue -- isn't binding to other courts, but some open government activists and media groups fear it will embolden DeSantis' use of executive authority.\n\nCatherine Cameron, a media law professor for Stetson University College of Law who has researched the issue, said DeSantis is among a handful of governors to use executive privilege to withhold public records -- and appears to be the only Florida governor in history to do so.\n\n\"I could find no instance of any Florida governor ever claiming executive privilege before DeSantis did,\" Cameron told NBC News.\n\nThe issue had never landed before a Florida court, as other governors \"probably didn't want to rock the boat,\" she added.\n\nIn February, DeSantis livestreamed a panel discussion calling for reforms to defamation law. Afterward, GOP lawmakers introduced legislation to make it easier for elected officials and other public figures to sue the media for defamation over critical news stories and commentary.\n\nAmong other changes, the measures aimed to strip reporters' legal privileges to keep anonymous sources confidential and lower the \"actual malice\" standard required for public officials to prove defamation. That standard, set by a landmark 1964 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, requires public figures to prove that journalists knowingly published false information or did so in \"reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\"\n\nThe First Amendment Foundation, a Tallahassee-based open government advocacy group, viewed DeSantis' attempt to reframe defamation law as \"the biggest threat to free speech and a free press\" during the state's legislative session, said Bobby Block, the group's executive director.\n\nThe bills failed to advance out of committee.\n\nBut other legislative efforts to chip away at public access proved successful. By the foundation's count, Florida's Legislature created 23 public records exemptions this session and reinstated nine others that were about to sunset. It's been nearly a decade since lawmakers came anywhere near that -- when they introduced 22 public records exemptions in 2014, Block said.\n\nOne of them bars disclosure of the governor's travel records and the visitor logs for his mansion.\n\nAt a public appearance in May, DeSantis said the bill was \"not necessarily something that I came up with,\" adding it was \"motivated by a security concern.\"\n\nFreshman state Rep. Jeff Holcomb, a Republican who introduced the legislation, told NBC News that the project \"was given to me by leadership\" to address security \"glitches.\"\n\n\"I would run this bill for a Democratic governor,\" said Holcomb, who called characterizations that the exemption keeps the public in the dark about vital information \"garbage.\"\n\nBlock said lawmakers could have narrowly tailored a measure to redact specific details about security personnel and strategies. But instead, they approved a \"wholesale exemption\" that now keeps secret details such as where the governor went, who he met with, the reason for his trip and how much it cost.\n\nDisclosure of such information in the past has helped identify taxpayer-funded travel abuses by at least two governors and other state officials, he said. What's more, the exemption was applied retroactively, keeping hidden details of DeSantis' past trips where security concerns are no longer an issue, Block said.\n\nDeSantis' office has denied that any records exist in response to some public records requests -- including one related to Hurricane Ian, a mass-casualty natural disaster.\n\nLate last year, the Executive Office of the Governor denied a public records request from NBC News for any communications -- texts, emails, voice messages or other exchanges -- sent or received by DeSantis in the days just before and after the hurricane made landfall, becoming one of the deadliest tropical storms in modern history. The office closed the request after less than a business day, saying a search \"produced no documents responsive\" to the request.\n\nDeSantis made national headlines in September, when his administration flew nearly 50 mostly Venezuelan migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, and left them there in protest of President Joe Biden's immigration policies. After the Florida Center for Government Accountability filed requests seeking communications and other records about the controversial flights, DeSantis' office responded 2\u00bd weeks later by releasing documents unrelated to what the group had asked for, court records show.\n\nOnly after the watchdog group sued did DeSantis' office start releasing some responsive records, though portions of those were blacked out. On Oct. 25, a trial court judge ruled DeSantis' office had violated the Public Records Act by improperly redacting some records and failing to turn over others within a reasonable time frame.\n\nThe judge ordered DeSantis' office to pay the group's legal fees and costs, and to turn over any remaining records within 20 days. But DeSantis' office failed to release all the records by the court's deadline, according to the judge's order.\n\nSince then, the office has disclosed some records, including those showing a top administration official sent emails via a private Gmail account while seeking to help a former legal client win a contract to oversee the migrant relocation program. DeSantis' office is now appealing the judge's ruling that it violated the state's record law by failing to disclose records in a reasonable time frame.\n\n\"It's outrageous. They're using private electronic devices and accounts to conduct official business,\" Barfield said. \"And when they're challenged, they fight tooth and nail.\"\n\nLikewise, Florida's state health department under DeSantis continues to fight a two-year-old lawsuit contending it violated the state's records act by failing to make Covid-19 data available during the height of the pandemic.\n\nDeSantis' administration, which has touted lifting pandemic restrictions in Florida before most other states, became a national outlier when it stopped publicly posting daily, detailed Covid-19 data in June 2021, just as infections surged amid the delta variant.\n\nCarlos Guillermo Smith, then a Democratic state representative from Orlando, later sued, contending the information was \"vital to the ability of citizens to understand the risks and make informed decisions about their lives.\"\n\nThe case remains pending amid state appeals.\n\n\"When they violate the Public Records Act, we need to hold them to account,\" Guillermo Smith said.",

            "title": "Despite acquittal, Durham trial of Sussmann added to evidence Clinton campaign plotted to tie Trump to Russia",
            "body": "WASHINGTON, D.C. - Key allegations that tied then-candidate Donald Trump to Russia and led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller originated with individuals linked to Hillary Clinton and her presidential campaign, with former officials now questioning why Mueller's team of seasoned prosecutors didn't report those connections as part of their years-long probe.\n\nDuring the trial of Michael Sussmann -- the first trial stemming from Special Counsel John Durham's years-long investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe -- Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook testified that Hillary Clinton herself approved the dissemination of unproven and subsequently debunked information to the media alleging a covert communications channel between the Trump Organization and Russia's Alfa Bank.\n\nThose allegations fell at the center of the Sussmann trial, as Sussmann had been charged with making a false statement to the FBI when he brought that information to FBI General Counsel James Baker on Sept. 19, 2016, and allegedly claimed he was not doing work on behalf of any client, but rather bringing the data as a citizen concerned with national security. Sussmann Monday was found not guilty by a jury.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON APPROVED DISSEMINATION OF TRUMP-RUSSIAN BANK ALLEGATIONS TO MEDIA, CAMPAIGN MANAGER TESTIFIES\n\nDurham's team alleged that Sussmann was, in fact, doing work for two clients: the Hillary Clinton campaign and a technology executive, Rodney Joffe. Following the meeting with Baker, Durham claimed Sussmann billed the Hillary Clinton campaign for his work.\n\nThe FBI ultimately opened an investigation into that information, and, according to Baker's testimony last week, the FBI found that, after weeks of investigating, \"there was nothing there.\"\n\nOther FBI agents and officials testified that they were \"unable to substantiate any of the allegations.\"\n\nBut the debunked Trump-Alfa Bank allegations aren't the only claims that originated with individuals related to the Clinton campaign.\n\nThe FBI on July 31, 2016, opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether candidate Donald Trump and members of his campaign were colluding or coordinating with Russia to influence the 2016 campaign. That investigation was referred to inside the bureau as \"Crossfire Hurricane.\"\n\nFLASHBACK: DNI DECLASSIFIES BRENNAN NOTES, CIA MEMO ON HILLARY CLINTON 'STIRRING UP' SCANDAL BETWEEN TRUMP, RUSSIA\n\nBut on July 28, 2016, then-CIA Director John Brennan briefed then-President Obama purported proposal from one of Hillary Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisers \"to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.\"\n\nFox News first obtained and reported on Brennan's handwritten notes memorializing that briefing.\n\n\"They are investigating an alleged Russian connection with Trump, and just weeks before the investigation began, the President and the Vice President, the FBI leadership and Strzok had been put on notice by the CIA of the fact that Hillary was going to implement a false flag operation that specifically focused on Trump and Russia,\" Ty Cobb, former White House Special Counsel responsible for the Trump White House's response to the Mueller investigation, told Fox News. \"The Strzok link to the Clinton intel is undeniable, and requires further investigation which Special Counsel Durham is likely pursuing. Perhaps the DOJ IG, Mr. Horowitz, who like Durham is someone I respect greatly, is as well.\"\n\nHe added: \"The country certainly deserves answers.\"\n\nCobb noted that the \"plan\" was \"so serious that Brennan briefed the president and national security advisor.\" Then-National Security Advisor Susan Rice is said to have been in that July 2016 briefing.\n\n\"That is much more unusual than merely referring the matter to the FBI,\" Cobb said.\n\nBut it was just ten days before Sussmann visited Baker at the FBI with the Trump-Alfa Bank allegations, on Sept. 9, 2016, that the CIA properly forwarded that information through a Counterintelligence Operational Lead (CIOL) to then-FBI Director James Comey and then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok, with the subject line: \"Crossfire Hurricane.\"\n\nFox News first obtained and reported on the CIOL, which stated: \"The following information is provided for the exclusive use of your bureau for background investigative action or lead purposes as appropriate.\"\n\n\"Per FBI verbal request, CIA provides the below examples of information the CROSSFIRE HURRICANE fusion cell has gleaned to date,\" the memo continued. \"An exchange [REDACTED] discussing US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's approval of a plan concerning US presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering US elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.\"\n\nThe memo was heavily redacted.\n\n\"The memo regarding Clinton's false Trump/Russia scheme goes to the FBI, goes specifically to Comey and Strzok -- Strzok became the lead investigator for first the DOJ and later the Mueller team and hand-picked many of the other investigators,\" Cobb told Fox News. \"It is certain he knew, and, because he knew, it is stunning that the investigation didn't wrap up sooner and that the final report doesn't mention the actual undeniable genesis of the original DOJ investigation that morphed into the Mueller effort.\"\n\n\"If Strzok had shared that information with Mueller, which I suspect he did not, it would have taken the investigation in a different direction and spared the nation two-plus years of press-fueled divisiveness and lies,\" Cobb continued.\n\nSUSSMANN-DURHAM TRIAL: MARC ELIAS SAYS HE BRIEFED CLINTON CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS ON FUSION GPS OPPO AGAINST TRUMP\n\nStrzok did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, the anti-Trump dossier was also linked to the Clinton campaign.\n\nClinton campaign general counsel Marc Elias testified as part of the Sussmann trial that he personally hired Fusion GPS -- the opposition research firm that commissioned the now-infamous anti-Trump dossier.\n\nFLASHBACK: NEWLY DECLASSIFIED INTEL DOCUMENT NOTED STEELE DOSSIER CLAIMS HAD 'LIMITED CORROBORATION'\n\nThe dossier contained allegations of purported coordination between Trump and the Russian government. It was authored by Christopher Steele, an ex-British intelligence officer.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC funded the dossier through the law firm Perkins Coie, where both Elias and Sussmann were employed at the time.\n\nThe Justice Department inspector general revealed that the unverified anti-Trump dossier helped serve as the basis for controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants obtained against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.\n\nAnd the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) on Russian election interference revealed that the dossier had, at the time, only \"limited corroboration.\" CIA officials at the time pushed back, arguing the dossier should not be included in the assessment, casting it as simply \"internet rumor.\"\n\nThe dossier has now been largely discredited.\n\nTRUMP REACTS TO TESTIMONY THAT CLINTON SPREAD RUSSIA ALLEGATIONS: 'WHERE DO I GET MY REPUTATION BACK?'\n\nThe FBI's investigation was handed off to Special Counsel Robert Mueller after Trump was elected. Mueller was appointed on May 17, 2017.\n\nBut Mueller's team did not appear to focus on the allegations being linked to Clinton-affiliated individuals.\n\nFormer acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker told Fox News that the Mueller team could \"suggest that it was outside their scope to look at the origins of the Russian collusion story.\"\n\n\"However, by not highlighting that the story was created by the Clinton campaign and prompted by the Clinton campaign, it calls into question their entire investigation,\" Whitaker said.\n\nProsecutors on Mueller's team had come under fire from then-President Donald Trump, who repeatedly referred to them as \"angry Democrats.\"\n\n\"As a former DOJ prosecutor myself, it is clear they lost their impartiality and violated the oath we all take as prosecutors,\" former chief investigator for the House Intelligence Committee's Trump-Russia probe Kash Patel told Fox News. \"Not to mention, Andrew Weismann was the general counsel at the FBI. He knows how to investigate, obtain FISAs, and check the credibility of witnesses if he wanted to. He never wanted to, and hid behind the fake news media wall, who all covered for Mueller.\"\n\nHe added: \"They didn't even need to dig, they just needed to abide by their oaths of office.\"\n\nOf the original 15 attorneys on Mueller's staff, at least seven had donated to Democratic candidates and campaigns, including Hillary Clinton. Among these, James Quarles donated $2,700 to Clinton's 2016 campaign, Jeannie Rhee donated a total of $5,400 to Clinton's 2016 campaign, and Elizabeth Prelogar and Rush Atkinson donated smaller amounts. Mueller top prosecutor Andrew Weissmann, Andrew Goldstein, and Brandon Van Grack also contributed to Democrats.\n\nFLASHBACK: MUELLER PROBE: MEET THE LAWYERS WHO GAVE $$ TO HILLARY, NOW INVESTIGATING TEAM TRUMP\n\n\"Because of what appeared to be political biases, they should have had a more fulsome description as to how this investigation even came out,\" Whitaker said. \"And so, it would've been smart on their part to cover their bases on that, but they left the door open and, rightfully, should be criticized for not fully explaining this.\"\n\n\"I just think it is really disappointing that the FBI had rejected these stories -- whether it is Alfa Bank and the secret server with the Trump Organization, or the dossier that the FBI reviewed and rejected as legitimate, and somehow found a home as it traveled up the hierarchy at the FBI and ultimately led to the appointment of Mueller,\" Whitaker told Fox News.\n\n\"It is extraordinarily disappointing, and it shouldn't happen like this,\" Whitaker said.\n\nAfter nearly two years, Mueller's more-than $30 million investigation yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"The country has a right to know the answer to this question, 'How is it that after $30 million, the fact that the Clinton campaign falsely initiated the investigation was omitted from their report?'\" Cobb asked. \"The simple, but incomplete, answer is Peter Strzok who didn't share the information with his FBI colleagues on the investigation he initiated and approved.\"\n\nCobb said that the \"complete answer\" refers back to the July 2016 briefing for Obama and top Obama officials.\n\n\"You don't have to be partisan to find that scary,\" Cobb said. \"This needs to be pursued so a soft coup of this type can never happen again under any future administrations.\"\n\n\"It's just not going to age well,\" Whitaker said.\n\nBut these Trump-Russia allegations did not only spur federal law enforcement investigations, but also congressional ones.\n\nThe House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Intelligence Committee opened investigations into whether Trump and members of his campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential race.\n\nHOUSE INTEL TRANSCRIPTS SHOW TOP OBAMA OFFICIALS HAD 'NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE' OF TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION\n\nUpon declassification of thousands of pages of transcripts from House Intelligence Committee interviews, Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., under pressure from Grenell and House Republicans, ultimately released them. The transcripts revealed, among other things, that top Obama officials acknowledged they had no \"empirical evidence\" of collusion or a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election. Fox News first reported on the transcripts.\n\nNeither the House nor Senate investigation found evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia.\n\nSENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE FINDS NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\n\nThe first two years of former President Trump's presidency was covered by the \"Russia\" cloud and, after bombshell testimony from Clinton's campaign manager last week, he is looking for vindication.\n\n\"This is one of the greatest political scandals in history,\" Trump told Fox News. \"For three years, I had to fight her off, and fight those crooked people off, and you'll never get your reputation fully back.\"\n\n\"Where do I get my reputation back?\" Trump said again.\n\nDurham was tapped in 2019, shortly after Mueller announced his findings, by Attorney General Bill Barr to investigate the origins of the FBI's original investigation into the Trump campaign, which led to the appointment of Mueller as special counsel.\n\nAt the time, Durham was serving as U.S. attorney for Connecticut.\n\nMueller's investigation yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn October 2020, Barr appointed Durham as special counsel to ensure that he would be able to continue his investigative work -- regardless of the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDurham has indicted three people as part of his investigation: Sussmann in September 2021, Igor Danchenko in November 2021 and Kevin Clinesmith in August 2020.",

            "title": "Presidential Power to Declassify Information, Explained",
            "body": "WASHINGTON -- Former President Donald J. Trump's claim that he had declassified all of the documents that the F.B.I. seized in the search of his Florida home last week -- including those marked as top secret -- has heightened interest in the scope of a president's power to declassify information.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump's office claimed that when he was president, he had a \"standing order\" that materials \"removed from the Oval Office and taken to the residence were deemed to be declassified the moment he removed them,\" according to a statement read on Fox News by a right-wing writer Mr. Trump has designated as one of his representatives to the National Archives.\n\nApart from whether there is any evidence that such an order actually existed, the notion has been greeted with disdain by national security legal specialists. Glenn S. Gerstell, the top lawyer for the National Security Agency from 2015 to 2020, pronounced the idea that whatever Mr. Trump happened to take upstairs each evening automatically became declassified -- without logging what it was and notifying the agencies that used that information -- \"preposterous.\"\n\nThe claim is also irrelevant to Mr. Trump's potential troubles over the document matter, because none of the three criminal laws cited in a search warrant as the basis of the investigation depend on whether documents contain classified information.\n\nStill, the novel claim is striking. Here is a closer look at what a president can and cannot do when it comes to removing protections for government secrets.\n\nWhat is the classification system?\n\nIt is the administrative process by which the federal government controls how executive branch officials handle information whose potential public exposure is deemed likely to damage national security.\n\nOfficials with the authority to classify or declassify matters can deem information as falling into three categories: confidential, secret or top secret. Access to particularly sensitive information can be restricted even further with a designation of S.C.I., for sensitive compartmented information.\n\nIf information is classified, access to it is restricted. Any documents containing that information are supposed to be marked, and only officials with proper security clearances -- and a \"need to know\" -- are permitted to see them or be told of their contents. There are also rules limiting how they can be stored, physically transported or electronically transmitted.\n\nThe legal basis for the classification system comes from the president's constitutional authority as commander in chief. Presidents have established and developed it through a series of executives orders dating to the era encompassing World War II and the early Cold War. The current directive, Executive Order 13526, was issued by President Barack Obama in 2009.\n\nIs the classification system enforced by criminal law?\n\nLargely not.\n\nFor the most part, the classification system is about bureaucratic controls. The main punishment for disobedience is administrative: Officials can be admonished, lose their security clearances and be fired.\n\nMore Coverage of the F.B.I. Search of Trump's HomeA Risky Decision: The F.B.I. search of former President Donald J. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate is a high-stakes gamble by the Justice Department, but Mr. Trump faces risks of his own.Trump's Reaction: In the wake of the search, Mr. Trump has accused the nation's justice system of being exactly what he tried to turn it into: a political weapon for a president.Calling Trump's Bluff: In moving to unseal the warrant, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland brought attention to the fact that Mr. Trump -- who claimed the search was baseless -- was free to release the documents in his possession, but had chosen not to do so.\n\nAs such, the classification system exists in parallel to separate criminal penalties Congress has imposed to protect security secrets.\n\nFor example, the Espionage Act of 1917 -- one of the laws cited in the search warrant -- protects secrets that it defines as defense-related information that could harm the United States or aid a foreign adversary. It makes no reference to classification status, and prosecutors in an Espionage Act case do not need to prove that anything was deemed classified.\n\nA rare exception, where Congress has tied a law to the classification system, is Section 1924 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, which makes the unauthorized retention or removal of classified material a crime. But that was not one of the laws that was listed in the search warrant as a focus of the investigation.\n\nWho has the power to classify and declassify information?\n\nIn the normal course of business, certain officials who have been designated as \"original classification authorities\" in federal departments and agencies can do so. They are considered to be exercising the president's power over such matters, which has been delegated to them.\n\nAre there formal procedures for declassifying information?\n\nYes. The 2009 executive order directs the head of the department or agency that originally deemed information classified to oversee declassification reviews, and it sets some standards for them.\n\nThe executive branch has regulations laying out the process that should be followed, such as a requirement to make sure that other agencies and departments with an interest in the secret are consulted. There are also procedures for the removal of classification markings on documents.\n\nCan presidents declassify matters directly?\n\nYes, because it is ultimately their constitutional authority.\n\nNormally, presidents who want something declassified direct subordinates overseeing the department or agency with primary responsibility for the information to review the matter with an eye to making more of it public. But on rare occasions, presidents declassify something directly.\n\nFor example, in 2004, President George W. Bush himself declassified a portion of his presidential daily intelligence briefing from August 2001 -- a month before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- in which he had been warned: \"Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.\"\n\nDo presidents have to obey the usual procedures?\n\nThere is no Supreme Court precedent definitively answering that question.\n\nEven if it is true that Mr. Trump had pronounced the documents declassified while he was in office, he clearly did not follow the regular procedures.\n\nIn the unlikely event that the Justice Department were to charge him under the law that makes the unauthorized retention or removal of classified material a crime -- despite not listing it as a focus of the investigation in the search warrant -- a novel question would arise if Mr. Trump were then to repeat the claim as a defense.\n\nProponents of a strong view of presidential power have argued in other contexts that presidents are not personally bound by the rules and procedures that regulate the conduct of their subordinates in the executive branch -- and that presidents can even disregard executive orders without first rescinding them. Others disagree with that vision of executive power.\n\nThe statement from Mr. Trump's office that was read aloud by the right-wing writer, John Solomon, included what appeared to be a gesture at them claim: \"The idea that some paper-pushing bureaucrat, with classification authority delegated by the president, needs to approve the declassification is absurd.\"\n\nWhat about nuclear secrets?\n\nThey are distinct, although for purposes of criminal law there is little substantive difference.\n\nCongress has passed a law, the Atomic Energy Act, that imposes its own legal restrictions on mishandling information about how to build a nuclear bomb or enrich nuclear material. Such information is called \"restricted data.\" Legally, it is not the same thing as being \"classified\" under the executive order, although in everyday parlance people often refer to it as classified.\n\nThe law established a process for making decisions about downgrading such protections. For those involving military weapons, Congress mandated that the decision be made jointly by senior officials at the Energy and Defense Departments; if the two departments disagree about whether or not to do so, the law says the president makes the final determination. So at a minimum, those officials must be involved in any decision to downgrade nuclear weapons information into so-called formerly restricted data.\n\nThe Atomic Energy Act made it a crime for officials to disclose restricted data without authorization. But whether or not dangerous nuclear weapons information remains deemed to be restricted data, the Espionage Act separately makes its unauthorized retention or disclosure a crime.\n\nCan a president secretly declassify information without leaving a written record or telling anyone?\n\nThat question, according to specialists in the law of government secrecy, is borderline incoherent.\n\nIf there is no directive memorializing a decision to declassify information and conveying it to the rest of the government, the action would essentially have no consequence, as departments and agencies would continue to consider that information classified and so would continue to restrict access to documents containing it.\n\n\"Hypothetical questions like 'What if a president thinks to himself that something is declassified? Does that change its status?' are so speculative that their practical meaning is negligible,\" said Steven Aftergood, a secrecy specialist with the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nHe added: \"It's a logical mess. The system is not meant to be deployed in such an arbitrary fashion.\"",

Katie Hobbs (D) sat down with 'Fox News Sunday' host Shannon Bream to discuss how the border crisis has impacted the state and why the debate over school choice is taking center stage.\n\nDemocrat Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs requested the social media website formerly known as Twitter to censor critics of her tweet that compared supporters of former President Trump to Nazis.\n\nIn August 2017, while serving in the Arizona state legislature, Hobbs attacked Trump in a post, when she compared the former president's voter base to neo-Nazis.\n\n\"[Trump] has made it abundantly clear he's more interested in pandering to his neo-nazi base than being [president] for all Americans,\" Hobbs wrote on her campaign\n\nWEAPONIZATION SUBCOMMITTEE BACKS STATE LAWSUIT IN BIDEN, BIG TECH CENSORSHIP CASE: 'UN-AMERICAN'\n\nHobbs was roasted online for the tweet, which did not sit well with Hobbs as she advanced in her political career to become Arizona secretary of state.\n\nThe post had critics online call into question Hobbs' impartiality when administering the election, and, according to emails obtained by Fox News Digital from conservative political organization AZCapitol, Hobbs tried to get Twitter, now known as X, to censor the criticism against her.\n\nOn Nov. 13, 2020, Hobbs emailed X -- using her official Arizona secretary of state email -- asking the support team to take action against her online trolls.\n\nThen-Twitter asked for more information and for Hobbs to provide examples for her request, which Hobbs was unable to provide.\n\nDHS AGENCY APPEARS TO BE 'BURYING' EVIDENCE OF INVOLVEMENT WITH 'DOMESTIC CENSORSHIP ACTIVITIES': EXPERT\n\nHobbs responded by claiming she was being harassed by \"alt-right\" online critics after calling political opponents Nazis.\n\n\"I am not sure I can provide the information you are asking for because I reported and then blocked multiple users at the same time,\" Hobbs wrote using her official resources as secretary of state.\n\n\"The alt-right got a hold of a 3-year-old tweet on my account and have been sending harassing, abusive, and threatening tweets and direct messages for the last 2 days,\" she added.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to X and Hobbs' office about the emails asking for Twitter to censor posts critical of her post comparing Trump supporters to the genocidal Nazi regime, but they did not immediately respond.\n\nThe revelation of Hobbs' emails comes as the federal government faces accusations of \"burying\" its involvement in censorship of Americans online.\n\nA federal agency in the Department of Homeland Security that has been scrutinized for what critics argue is suppression of dissenting political views under the guise of combating disinformation now appears to be \"burying\" evidence of its alleged censorship, experts and watchdog groups say.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has come under fire for working with Big Tech companies to flag and take down social media posts related to elections, COVID vaccines, and a range of other issues that were deemed mis-, dis-, and malinformation.\n\nNow, it appears the agency may be concealing its efforts to monitor domestic content posted by regular Americans and focusing exclusively on its campaign to combat foreign actors in what some observers say is a move designed to hide government overreach, according to research compiled by Mike Benz, the Foundation for Freedom Online's executive director.\n\n\"CISA pulled a fast one on the American public by setting up a social media censorship division in the name of fighting foreign influence, but then quickly seizing long-arm jurisdiction over domestic opinions online as well,\" Benz told Fox News Digital. \"CISA officials knew they lacked the legal authorization to do what they did. Now, CISA appears to be burying the evidence of its domestic censorship activities, right as oversight of potential malfeasance is heating up.\"\n\nBenz is hardly the first person to note CISA had questionable legal authorization to combat election disinformation.\n\n\"There was a lack of capability around election disinformation. This is not because CISA didn't care about disinformation, but at the time they lacked both kind of the funding and the legal authorizations to go do the kinds of work that would be necessary to truly understand how election disinformation was operating,\" Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, said last year at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council think tank.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Stanford Internet Observatory helped convene the Election Integrity Partnership (EIP), a project combining a coalition of government, Big Tech, civil society, academia, and others \"to defend our elections against online behavior harmful to the democratic process.\"\n\nThe EIP worked with CISA and others to target what it deemed online disinformation.",

            "title": "After Racist Comments, Los Angeles City Council President Faces Calls to Resign",
            "body": "LOS ANGELES -- The president of the Los Angeles City Council faced widespread calls to resign on Sunday after a leaked audio recording revealed racist and disparaging remarks about the Black child of a white council member and also about Indigenous immigrants in the city's Koreatown neighborhood.\n\nThe comments, made during a meeting last year with two other council members and a labor official, exposed longstanding racial tensions in the governance of one of the nation's most multicultural cities as well as fault lines among the city's Democrats.\n\nIn the profanity-laced recording, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times and which was first reported by The Los Angeles Times, the City Council president, Nury Martinez, who is Latina, compared the Black child of a white council member to a \"changuito,\" Spanish for little monkey. She also called Oaxacan immigrants living in Koreatown \"short little dark people.\"\n\nIt was unclear who leaked the recording of the October 2021 meeting, which included Gil Cedillo and Kevin de Le\u00f3n, council members representing parts of the city's East Side, and Ron Herrera, president of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. Also unknown was who made the recording, which was initially uploaded to Reddit earlier this month by an unidentified, now-suspended user, and continued to circulate via email after the post was taken down. No one has disputed the recording's authenticity, and Ms. Martinez and Mr. de Le\u00f3n have issued apologies.\n\nAlthough advocates on all sides of upcoming city races are unleashing information to sway voters, the exact motivation behind the release of the recording was not immediately clear. But an unsigned introduction in the Reddit post, shared via screenshot with the recording, denounced the ties between organized labor and some members of the Council, including Ms. Martinez, complaining that \"the labor movement is in bed with City Hall.\"\n\nThe four officials in the meeting were strategizing about political redistricting in advance of this year's election. Mr. Herrera can be heard telling the group that \"my goal is to get the three of you elected, and I'm just focused on that -- we're like a little Latino caucus of our own.\"\n\nA citizen advisory committee conducts Los Angeles's redistricting process each decade and recommends maps, but the final lines are determined by the Council, which ultimately approved a map far different from the one that was recommended. The conversation focused on those heated negotiations and on the distribution among the 15 council districts of economic and municipal \"assets\" such as stadiums, universities and airports. Such assets provide jobs to constituents and can enhance an officeholder's political influence and fund-raising abilities.\n\nIn the audio, the group echoed long held complaints about Latino representation in the city, where Latinos make up about half of the population but hold only about a third of the seats on the Council. Ms. Martinez complained that the commission had recommended moving key assets, such as the Van Nuys airport, out of her district while claiming to back broader representation for Latinos.\n\n\"If you're going to talk about Latino districts, what kind of districts are you trying to create?\" she asked her colleagues. \"Because you're taking away our assets. You're just going to create poor Latino districts with nothing?\"\n\nMs. Martinez, who is not up for re-election until 2024, added that Nithya Raman, a council member of South Asian descent, should not represent Koreatown, which is now largely Latino.\n\nMs. Martinez also weighed in on a dispute between two Black council members over whose district would include Exposition Park and the University of Southern California. Rather than fight among themselves, she said, they should demand a map in which one of them gets the massive Los Angeles International Airport. That asset, she noted, is in the district of a white council member, Mike Bonin, whom she referred to with a vulgarity.\n\nIn the ensuing exchange, Mr. de Le\u00f3n referred to Mr. Bonin, a West Los Angeles liberal, as the council's \"fourth Black member\" and joked with Ms. Martinez that Mr. Bonin carried his adopted son, who is Black, as if the toddler were a designer handbag. Ms. Martinez complained that on a parade float on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Mr. Bonin had failed to control his son and said that the child's antics had nearly tipped the float over.\n\n\"They're raising him like a little white kid,\" Ms. Martinez says. \"I was like, this kid needs a beatdown. Let me take him around the corner, and then I'll bring him back.\"\n\nShe also cursed George Gasc\u00f3n, the Los Angeles County district attorney, saying that \"he's with the Blacks.\"\n\nNews of the audio ricocheted around Los Angeles on Sunday, eliciting shock and fury but also acknowledgment of the complexity of race relations in the sprawling city. The furor extended to the city's increasingly tight race for mayor between Rick Caruso, a billionaire developer and police commissioner endorsed by Mr. Cedillo, and Representative Karen Bass, who is Black and was endorsed by Ms. Martinez.\n\n\"This entire situation shows that City Hall is fundamentally broken and dysfunctional,\" Mr. Caruso said in a statement. \"In a closed-door meeting, leaders at the highest levels of city government used racial slurs and hate speech while discussing how to carve up the city to retain their own power.\"\n\nMs. Bass issued a condemnation as well. \"Let me be clear about what was on those tapes: appalling, anti-Black racism,\" she said in a statement, adding that she had \"spent the day speaking with Black and Latino leaders about how to ensure this doesn't divide our city.\"\n\n\"Homelessness is out of control, crime is on the rise, and Angelenos are being priced out of their hometown,\" she said. \"The challenges we face already threaten to tear us apart and, now, this hateful and shocking conversation among some of our city's most powerful leaders could divide us even further. All those in the room must be held accountable.\"\n\nEunisses Hernandez, a progressive who in June won Mr. Cedillo's council seat in an upset, said she was \"beyond disgusted.\"\n\n\"We have three sitting council members being explicit about the Black community, and their language exemplifies anti-Blackness,\" she said. \"How is it we have these people in leadership?\"\n\nLatinos are by far the largest demographic among the city's 3.8 million residents. But the Black community in Los Angeles has long wielded greater clout than would be suggested by its 8.8 percent of the population, and the Asian community has become a rising political force with nearly 12 percent of the population. White Angelenos, with more than 28 percent of the population, have long controlled much of the city's wealth and power.\n\nResidents of the city routinely tout their diversity as an asset, and, since the 1992 riots, have expressed pride in the strides they have made in race relations. In polls, Latino residents of the city repeatedly say that their Black neighbors understand them better than do any other ethnic group in Los Angeles, and vice versa, said Fernando Guerra, whose Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University regularly surveys the city's residents.\n\nMr. Guerra said that when he heard the recording, he was appalled, particularly at the remarks about Mr. Bonin's child. But he also noted that, as in most of California, getting along remains a work in progress and that unlike the county and state, the city of Los Angeles still allows elected officials, rather than an independent commission, to have the final say in their own district maps. That practice, he said, has contributed to ongoing racial tensions.\n\nIn drawing a fair map, the council \"had to talk about race,\" Mr. Guerra said. \"Although not like this.\"\n\nCalls for Ms. Martinez to step down as president or resign from the council altogether came from politicians across the state as well as business owners and activists. Ms. Martinez, who did not respond to a question about whether she would step down, did not deny making the remarks, and she apologized for the comments.\n\n\"In a moment of intense frustration and anger, I let the situation get the best of me, and I hold myself accountable for these comments. For that I am sorry,\" she said in a statement. \"The context of this conversation was concern over the redistricting process and concern about the potential negative impact it might have on communities of color. My work speaks for itself.\"\n\nMr. de Le\u00f3n, who also is not up for re-election, apologized as well. \"There were comments made in the context of this meeting that are wholly inappropriate,\" he said in a statement, \"and I regret appearing to condone and even contribute to certain insensitive comments made about a colleague and his family in private. I've reached out to that colleague personally. On that day, I fell short of the expectations we set for our leaders -- and I will hold myself to a higher standard.\"\n\nMr. Cedillo did not respond to requests for comments, and neither did Mr. Herrera. But Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, who heads the California Labor Federation, condemned the comments as \"repulsive and unacceptable\" in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n\"Black and brown communities are too often pitted against each other in our fight for equity,\" she said.\n\nMarqueece Harris-Dawson, a Black council member who represents some of the city's historic Black communities, not only condemned the comments from colleagues whom he had considered friends but also called for an investigation into the private meeting. He said that it may have violated the state's government transparency law and called into question the entire redistricting process. \"I don't think we've ever faced anything like this, so we have to figure out a path,\" he said.\n\nIn a searing joint statement, Mr. Bonin and his husband, Sean Arian, said that they were \"appalled, angry and absolutely disgusted\" by Ms. Martinez's comments and called on her, Mr. de Le\u00f3n and Mr. Herrera to resign from their positions. The couple added that \"it hurts that one of our son's earliest encounters with overt racism comes from some of the most powerful public officials in Los Angeles.\"\n\nIn condemning the entire conversation, Mr. Bonin and Mr. Arian said that it showed a troubling level of coordination in an effort to \"weaken Black political representation.\"\n\nMs. Raman, a liberal who won her council seat amid the social justice reckonings of 2020, said that she was horrified and disappointed and that she echoed the calls for resignations. \"I think there's always conflict in politics, but the level of blatant racism on display here was shocking and appalling,\" Ms. Raman said. \"We can't normalize this.\"",

            "body": "Washington, D.C. - Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey insisted Sunday that cartels are the ones shaping policy at the U.S.-Mexico border, as the Biden administration acts as their \"marketing arm\" in failing to curb illegal immigration.\n\nSpeaking to a Fox News Digital reporter ahead of the National Governors Association Winter Meeting in Washington, D.C., Ducey, a Republican, agreed that there's a correlation between rising crime plaguing several major U.S. cities and an influx of unchecked migrants entering the country.\n\n\"Well, of course, there's a link between criminals coming over the border and rising crime - of that, there's no doubt,\" he said. \"We've got nearly two million people that we've apprehended at this time. So, border security is national security. The federal government is failing at that.\"\n\nLEAKED VIDEO SHOWS FEDERAL CONTRACTORS FLYING MIGRANTS TO SUBURBAN NY: 'BETRAYING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'\n\n\"But I also think that there's a humanitarian crisis in terms of human smuggling, child sex trafficking and the drug trade,\" Ducey continued, addressing the subject of illegal immigration. \"The cartels are really shaping border policy right now. And the Biden administration is their marketing arm.\"\n\n\"We don't know who we're not catching. These people are coming from 120-plus countries, including countries that harbor terrorists,\" Ducey said. \"So, of course we could have something terrible happen to our nation by this lack of attention to the federal border. But we could also just have this crime, violence, vandalism and murder that we see. So, there's no doubt about it that there's a link to it.\"\n\nHis remarks come after Fox News reported earlier this week about a leaked video showing federal contractors flying migrants from southern border states to suburban New York.\n\nBody camera footage obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request captured an August 2021 exchange on the tarmac of a Westchester airport. In the video, Westchester Police Sgt. Michael Hamborsky grilled federal contractors about why he was not briefed about the flights, to which they responded they had instructions from Homeland Security to keep the matter on the \"down low.\"\n\n\"The government is betraying the American people,\" a federal contractor told the officer.\n\nFox News also obtained video showing a recent spat between Border Patrol agents and their chief during a visit by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The verbal disagreement highlights rising tensions between agents and the Biden administration - whose policies many agents believe are stopping them from keeping the border secure. An agent admitted that morale is at an all-time low.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn another high-profile incident last week, a Houston-area corporal was shot and killed during a traffic stop.

            "body": "Washington -- Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that NATO members have the go-ahead to send fighter jets to Ukraine as the U.S. and allies continue their efforts to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's invasion.\n\n\"That gets a green-light,\" Blinken said in an interview with \"Face the Nation\" when asked whether the Polish government, a member of NATO, could send fighter planes to Ukraine. \"In fact, we're talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if in fact they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they are handing over to the Ukrainians?\"\n\nA White House spokesperson told CBS News the Biden administration is evaluating the capabilities it could provide to backfill jets to Poland if it decided to transfer planes to Ukraine but noted there are several questions that arise from a decision to do so, including how the jets could be transferred from Poland to Ukraine.\n\nOksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., told \"Face the Nation\" she hopes Ukraine will receive fighter jets from Poland \"as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"We are working with our American, especially, friends and allies, on the steady supply of all the ammunition and anti-air, anti-tank and planes to be able to effectively defend our country,\" she said.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has sparked worldwide support for the Ukrainian people and a united response from the West. The U.S. and European allies have provided military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia's biggest financial institutions, Russian oligarchs and top officials in Moscow, including President Vladimir Putin himself and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, as part of efforts to cut the country off from the global financial system. Putin on Saturday said the sanctions are \"like a war.\"\n\nBlinken, who was in eastern Europe meeting with U.S. allies, said NATO countries and members of the Group of 7 are \"working together\" to raise the pressure on Russia, including through additional sanctions, which will be implemented in the coming days.\n\n\"The impact of the sanctions is already devastating,\" the secretary of state said. \"The ruble is in freefall. Their stock market's been shuttered for almost a week. We're seeing a recession set in in Russia. Consumers aren't able to buy basic products because companies are fleeing Russia, so it's having a big impact.\"\n\nStill, Blinken noted that Putin is \"doubling down and digging in on this aggression against Ukraine.\"\n\n\"I think we have to be prepared, unfortunately, tragically, for this to go on for some time,\" he said.\n\nMarkarova said Ukraine is thankful to the West for its continued support but suggested the international community needs to respond quicker because the Russians are \"escalating\" their attacks.\n\n\"It's clear after 11 days that we also need all of us to move faster,\" she said. Ukraine, she continued, did not provoke an attack from Russia.\n\n\"We were not a threat to Russia unless being a peaceful democracy and just peacefully living in your own country is a threat,\" she said. \"And if it's so, then it's not only about Ukraine, then Europe and the whole world is not safe.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky participated in a Zoom call with U.S. lawmakers on Saturday, during which he urged them to provide his country with military planes and impose an embargo on Russian oil. He also reiterated to lawmakers it could be the final time they see him alive, echoing a warning he has issued to European leaders.\n\nAsked whether the U.S. is working on a contingency plan to support the Ukrainian government should something happen to Zelensky, Blinken praised his leadership and indicated Ukrainian officials are prepared.\n\n\"The Ukrainians have plans in place, that I'm not going to talk about or get into any details on, to make sure that there is what we would call 'continuity of government' one way or another,\" he said. \"And let me leave it at that.\"\n\nThe secretary of state was steadfast that even if Russia's war in Ukraine continues for months, the Ukrainians will prevail.\n\n\"Winning a battle is not the same thing as winning a war. Taking the city is not the same thing as capturing the hearts and minds of Ukrainians,\" he said. \"What they've demonstrated with extraordinary courage is that they will not be subjugated to Vladimir Putin's will and be under Russia's thumb. So whether that takes another week, another month, another year to play out, it will, and I know how this is going to end. But the question is, can we end it sooner rather than later with less suffering going forward? That's the challenge.\"",

            "body": "WASHINGTON -- History is full of strange odysseys and intersections.\n\nBut it's bizarre that two men who were both front page news in the Friday Times started on similar paths and, with a consequential encounter along the way, ended up so differently.\n\nDonald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky both played leaders on TV shows and then became leaders in real life. They both used social media to gain power. And they both had zany acting gigs.\n\nIn 2015, Trump, who had a cameo in \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,\" debated whether to play a president in \"Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!\" or actually run for the presidency.\n\nZelensky starred in romantic comedies and played the president of Ukraine in a sitcom. He shimmied in a fringed, hot-pink number to win the Ukrainian version of \"Dancing With the Stars,\" did the voice of Paddington Bear when the \"Paddington\" movies were dubbed in Ukrainian, and entertained a roaring live audience by dropping his pants and providing a lewd performance of \"Hava Nagila\" -- a nod to his Jewish heritage.\n\nBut after they ascended to power, the would-be president of \"Sharknado 3\" and the Ukrainian voice of Paddington Bear took on very different roles.\n\nTrump became a blackguard. Zelensky donned a white hat. Trump tried to overturn American democracy. Zelensky tried to save Ukrainian democracy.\n\nTrump was always a faux tough guy who bragged about grabbing women and loved all things military except serving in it. Cadet Bone Spurs. Courage was an alien concept to this spoiled brat; he has always been a bully who let other people do the fighting for him.\n\nHe sicced a mob on the Capitol, while he went back to the comfort of the White House to watch his attempted coup play out on TV and to gloat about the frightened, barricaded lawmakers and his own trapped vice president.\n\nZelensky has stayed rooted in Kyiv to rally the morale of his brutalized country and face down Vladimir Putin and the invading Russian army. He admits he is afraid, but he doesn't show it as danger closes in. Zelensky knows, as Putin's \"Target No. 1,\" he could lose his life.\n\nThe 44-year-old Ukrainian president has become a symbol of bravery. His leadership has been defined by nimble action against overwhelming odds, great one-liners like \"I need ammunition, not a ride,\" and modesty. As he said in his inauguration speech in 2019: \"I would very much like for you to not have my portrait in your offices. No portraits! A president is not an icon, nor an idol. A president is not a portrait. Put photographs of your children there, instead. And before making any decision, look them in the eyes.\"\n\nStubbly and exhausted, operating on three hours of sleep a night, dressed in an Army-green T-shirt, he dragged his own chair into position at a news conference he held while in hiding.\n\nTrump, in a nimbus of selfishness and narcissism, inverted revered American ideals. He soiled the image of his country and reshaped it around his grievances and inadequacies.\n\nZelensky stood up for Ukrainian ideals. He helped imbue his country with a shining, resilient image, reinforced when the world saw remarkable images of battle-ready mothers and grannies making Molotov cocktails.\n\nTrump was impeached in 2019 for withholding military aid to Ukraine -- (\"I would like you to do us a favor though\") -- until Zelensky dug up dirt on Joe Biden, Trump's rival, and Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.\n\nAs Franklin Foer wrote in The Atlantic, before that call, America had always tried to inject morality into Ukrainian politics. But Trump \"polluted Ukraine with his own transactional politics.\"\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff and other Democratic leaders of that impeachment say people can now see how wrong Trump was to try to withhold aid to Zelensky, then in office only two months.\n\n\"It hammers home how despicable an act it was to treat Ukraine as a political plaything,\" Schiff told Rolling Stone.\n\nThe claim by Trump and his sycophants that his relationship with Putin had kept Russia out of Ukraine is ludicrous. He was Putin's poodle and Putin would have rolled over him; he was biding his time as Trump weakened NATO.\n\nTrump praised Putin for an act of \"genius\" even as the rest of the world was watching in horror as the mad Russian president prepared to order the bloody march through Ukraine and suffocated the remnants of a free press in Moscow.\n\nThat was a shameful moment, as was a House committee on Wednesday producing evidence it said showed that Trump had conspired to commit fraud and obstruction by bamboozling Americans about the election and trying to flip the result.\n\nThere were even some Republicans -- mirabile dictu -- backing away from the toxic Trump over Ukraine. In a speech prepared for top G.O.P. donors Friday night in New Orleans, Mike Pence included the line, \"There is no room in this party for apologists for Putin.\"\n\nBy standing up to the Evil Empire, Zelensky could earn comparisons to another performer turned pol, and that should grate on Trump as much as having his vice president turn on him.\n\nRonald Reagan helped lift the Iron Curtain. Zelensky is trying his best to stop it from slamming down again.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

            "body": "PALM BEACH, Fla. - Former President Donald Trump announced that he is running for the 2024 Republican nomination for president, seeking to stage a dramatic return to the White House after having lost his bid for re-election to Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nTrump, a Republican and the leader of the \"Make America Great Again\" movement, announced his third presidential bid on Tuesday during a speech at his Mar-a-Lago, Florida, home after having teased a bid since leaving office in 2021.\n\n\"In order to make America great and glorious again. I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,\" Trump said Tuesday evening to a crowd of supporters.\n\n\"I am running because I believe the world has not yet seen the true glory of what this nation can be. We have not reached that pinnacle, believe it or not,\" he continued.\n\n2024 WATCH: MEET THE POTENTIAL GOP PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS\n\nHe first won the presidency in 2016 against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. If he is elected again, he would become only the second president to retake the White House after having been ousted, a feat achieved by Grover Cleveland in 1892 after he had lost the presidency to Benjamin Harrison in 1888. A victory would make Trump the 45th and the 47th president.\n\nSince his loss, Trump has challenged the legitimacy of the 2020 election results, repeatedly claiming the race was \"rigged,\" due to the COVID pandemic-era process of mail-in ballots. Trump falsely claimed the election was stolen, and his legal team filed a slew of lawsuits in battleground states across the nation.\n\nTrump's announcement comes one week after the 2022 midterm elections in which Republicans did not obtain an anticipated \"red wave\" of victories. Democrats kept control of the Senate and if Republicans are able to capture a majority in the House, it is expected to be slight. The former president was heavily involved in the midterms, throwing his support behind Republican candidates across the nation. During the primaries, the majority of Trump-endorsed candidates were victorious, becoming the GOP nominee in their races.\n\nREPUBLICAN MEGA-DONOR KEN GRIFFIN SAYS IT'S TIME TO 'MOVE ON' FROM TRUMP, BACKS DESANTIS FOR 2024\n\nThe economy, which has been a top issue for voters during the 2022 midterm election cycle amid record-high inflation, was strong under Trump's presidency -- with an increase in middle-class family income, the lowest unemployment rate in half a century and unprecedented job growth.\n\nThe stock market hit record highs, with the Dow closing above 20,000 for the first time in 2017 and topping 30,000 in 2020, and the S&P 500 and NASDAQ also hitting record highs.\n\nTrump also worked to cut red tape and reduce regulations facing American businesses and workers, working to put in place policies to bring back supply chains from overseas, in line with his \"Make America Great Again\" and \"America First\" messaging.\n\nAs for trade relations, Trump immediately withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and ended the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in January 2017, replacing it with the existing United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which included new protections for American manufacturers and workers.\n\nIF TRUMP ENDORSED GOP NOMINEES LOSE IN NOVEMBER, DOES THE FORMER PRESIDENT TAKE A 2024 HIT?\n\nTrump also signed an executive order making it government policy to \"Buy American and Hire American,\" and took action to stop outsourcing of jobs overseas.\n\nAnother issue for Americans during the midterm election cycle has been energy and record-high gas prices.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, Trump ensured that the U.S. was the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, but President Biden reversed some of those policies and refocused on clean energy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration's foreign policy message was one that focused on \"peace through strength.\"\n\nTrump withdrew from the Iran Nuclear Deal -- which the Biden administration began taking steps to re-enter when he took office in 2021.\n\nTrump held a historic summit with Kim Jong Un in June 2018 -- he was the first sitting U.S. president to cross the demilitarized zone into North Korea. ICBM testing was paused during the Trump administration, but North Korea did continue to test for short and medium-range ballistic missiles. North Korea has been ramping up its ballistic missile testing under the Biden administration.\n\nTRUMP DROPS NEW HINTS ON POSSIBLE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RUN: 'WE WERE SO CLOSE'\n\nRegarding the Middle East, the Trump administration brokered the Abraham accords, a \"historic peace agreement\" between Israel and the United Arab Emirates that normalized relations and created bilateral agreements regarding \"investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications, technology, energy, health care, culture, the environment, the establishment of reciprocal embassies, and other areas of mutual benefit.\"\n\nIn 2018, the Trump administration moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem - a relocation long debated in Washington - and one that showed the U.S. officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n\nTrump's administration also rebuilt the military, with more than $2.2 trillion in defense spending, delivering pay raises for service members and their families. Trump's administration also created a new branch of the military -- the Space Force.\n\nTrump appointed and had three conservative justices confirmed to the Supreme Court during his presidency -- Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nDONALD TRUMP EDGES OUT PRESIDENT BIDEN IN ELECTION POLL AS BIDEN SLIPS BELOW 40% APPROVAL\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's administration worked to make communities safer, signing the First Step Act into law--the first landmark criminal justice reform legislation passed to reduce recidivism and help former inmates successfully rejoin society.\n\nA law-and-order president, Trump delivered support for law enforcement and put a major focus on protecting and securing the U.S.-Mexico southern border.\n\nTrump's presidency, from 2017 to 2021, was clouded by investigations -- several into whether he colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election, some focused on his finances and others that led to impeachment, making him the first president in United States history to have been impeached twice.\n\nTrump's post-presidential life has been reminiscent of his days in the Oval Office, marred by probes, which the former president and his allies said were just part of an effort by his political opponents to prevent him from running for re-election in 2024.\n\nThe former president is currently under federal investigation by the Justice Department for allegedly mishandling classified documents under the Presidential Records Act. A federal judge appointed Judge Raymond Dearie to serve as special master and review the thousands of records seized by the FBI. Trump and his legal team have argued that none of the documents taken from his Mar-a-Lago home were classified.\n\nTRUMP 'LOVES THE IDEA OF TESTIFYING' BEFORE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE: SOURCE CLOSE TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT\n\nThe FBI conducted an unprecedented pre-dawn raid of his private residence at Mar-a-Lago in August, alleging that the former president had classified national security information.\n\nThe investigation comes amid a criminal investigation into Trump and his family's business practices by New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump raised $10.2 million in August after the FBI's unprecedented raid -- the most Save America PAC had raised in a month since Trump was in office. As of mid-October, Trump's Save America PAC had just under $100 million cash-on-hand.\n\nAlso this summer, a federal appeals court paved the way for the House Ways and Means Committee to finally obtain Trump's tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service -- something the panel has been trying to obtain since 2019, under a law that permits the disclosure of an individual's tax returns to the congressional committee.\n\nTrump may seek emergency intervention measures from the Supreme Court in an attempt to temporarily block any release of these tax records -- which likely will come under renewed scrutiny now that he decided to run for a third time.\n\nWhen Trump first took office in January 2017, the FBI was in the middle of conducting a counterintelligence investigation into whether candidate Donald Trump and members of his campaign were colluding or coordinating with Russia to influence the 2016 election. That investigation was referred to inside the bureau as \"Crossfire Hurricane,\" and began on July 31, 2016.\n\nThat investigation was opened, despite then-CIA Director John Brennan briefing then-President Obama on July 28, 2016 about a purported proposal from one of Hillary Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisers \"to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.\"\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller ultimately was appointed to take over the investigation, but, after nearly two years, Mueller's investigation, which concluded in March 2019, yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nSpecial Counsel John Durham is currently investigating the origins of the FBI's Trump-Russia probe.\n\nWeeks after Mueller's probe was complete, Trump had a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during which he pressed Zelenskyy to launch investigations into the Biden family's actions and business dealings in Ukraine -- specifically Hunter Biden's ventures with Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings. Hunter Biden, at the time, was, and still is, under federal criminal investigation for his tax affairs, prompted by suspicious foreign transactions.\n\nThe president's request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and some witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement. Democrats also claimed Trump was meddling in the next presidential election by asking a foreign leader to look into a Democratic political opponent.\n\nTrump's conversation with Zelenskyy prompted a whistleblower complaint, which led to the House impeachment inquiry, and ultimately, impeachment proceedings in the Senate.\n\nThe House voted to impeach Trump in December 2019 on two counts -- abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate voted for acquittal in February 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, on Jan. 6, 2021, pro-Trump rioters breached the U.S. Capitol during a joint session of Congress to certify the Electoral College results in favor of President Biden. Trump was permanently banned from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube after the riot.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe House of Representatives then drafted articles of impeachment against him again, and ultimately voted to impeach him on a charge of inciting an insurrection for the Jan. 6 Capitol riot -- making him the first and only president to be impeached, and ultimately acquitted, twice in history.\n\nTrump's legal team denounced the proceedings as an unconstitutional \"sham impeachment\" against a private citizen, driven by Democrats' \"hatred\" for Trump and desire to silence a political opponent.\n\nThe Senate voted to acquit, but had Trump been convicted, the Senate would have moved to bar the 45th president from holding federal office ever again, preventing a 2024 White House run.",

            "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Biden is considering deploying several thousand U.S. troops, as well as warships and aircraft, to NATO allies in the Baltics and Eastern Europe, an expansion of American military involvement amid mounting fears of a Russian incursion into Ukraine, according to administration officials.\n\nThe move would signal a major pivot for the Biden administration, which up until recently was taking a restrained stance on Ukraine, out of fear of provoking Russia into invading. But as President Vladimir V. Putin has ramped up his threatening actions toward Ukraine, and talks between American and Russian officials have failed to discourage him, the administration is now moving away from its do-not-provoke strategy.\n\nIn a meeting on Saturday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, senior Pentagon officials presented Mr. Biden with several options that would shift American military assets much closer to Mr. Putin's doorstep, the administration officials said. The options include sending 1,000 to 5,000 troops to Eastern European countries, with the potential to increase that number tenfold if things deteriorate.\n\nThe officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about internal deliberations.\n\nMr. Biden is expected to make a decision as early as this week, they said. He is weighing the buildup as Russia has escalated its menacing posture against Ukraine, including massing more than 100,000 troops and weaponry on the border and stationing Russian forces in Belarus. On Saturday, Britain accused Moscow of developing plans to install a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine.\n\n\"Even as we're engaged in diplomacy, we are very much focused on building up defense, building up deterrence,\" Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"NATO itself will continue to be reinforced in a significant way if Russia commits renewed acts of aggression. All of that is on the table.\"\n\nSo far, none of the military options being considered include deploying additional American troops to Ukraine itself, and Mr. Biden has made clear that he is loath to enter another conflict following America's painful exit from Afghanistan last summer after 20 years.\n\nBut after years of tiptoeing around the question of how much military support to provide to Ukraine, for fear of provoking Russia, Biden officials have recently warned that the United States could throw its weight behind a Ukrainian insurgency should Mr. Putin invade Ukraine.\n\nAnd the deployment of thousands of additional American troops to NATO's eastern flank, which includes Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Biden administration officials said, is exactly the scenario that Mr. Putin has wanted to avoid, as he has seen the western military alliance creep closer and closer to Russia's own border.\n\nThe discussions came as the State Department ordered all family members of U.S. embassy personnel in Kyiv to leave Ukraine, citing the threat of Russian military action, and authorized some embassy employees to depart as well, according to senior State Department officials who briefed reporters on Sunday. The officials, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment, declined to say how many embassy personnel and family members were in the country. Thinning out staff at American embassies is a common precaution when conflicts or other crises arise that could put American diplomats in harm's way.\n\nIn his news conference last week, Mr. Biden said he had cautioned Mr. Putin that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would prompt Washington to send more troops to the region.\n\n\"We're going to actually increase troop presence in Poland, in Romania, et cetera, if in fact he moves,\" Mr. Biden said. \"They are part of NATO.\"\n\nDuring a phone call this month, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III warned his Russian counterpart, Sergey Shoygu, that a Russian incursion into Ukraine would most likely result in the exact troop buildup that Mr. Biden is now considering.\n\nAt the time of the phone call -- Jan. 6 -- the Biden administration was still trying to be more restrained in its stance on Ukraine. But after unsuccessful talks between Mr. Blinken and the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Friday, the administration is eying a more muscular posture, including not only diplomatic options like sanctions, but military options like increasing military support to Ukrainian forces and deploying American troops to the region.\n\n\"This is clearly in response to the sudden stationing of Russian forces in Belarus, on the border, essentially, with NATO,\" said Evelyn Farkas, the top Pentagon official for Russia and Ukraine during the Obama administration. \"There is no way that NATO could not reply to such a sudden military move in this political context. The Kremlin needs to understand that they are only escalating the situation with all of these deployments and increasing the danger to all parties, including themselves.\"\n\nA former top Pentagon official for Europe and NATO policy, Jim Townsend, said the administration's proposal did not go far enough.\n\n\"It's likely too little too late to deter Putin,\" Mr. Townsend said in an email. \"If the Russians do invade Ukraine in a few weeks, those 5,000 should be just a down payment for a much larger U.S. and allied force presence. Western Europe should once again be an armed camp.\"\n\nUnderstand the Escalating Tensions Over UkraineCard 1 of 5\n\nA brewing conflict. Antagonism between Ukraine and Russia has been simmering since 2014, when the Russian military crossed into Ukrainian territory, annexing Crimea and whipping up a rebellion in the east. A tenuous cease-fire was reached in 2015, but peace has been elusive.\n\nA spike in hostilities. Russia has recently been building up forces near its border with Ukraine, and the Kremlin's messaging toward its neighbor has hardened. Concern grew in late October, when Ukraine used an armed drone to attack a howitzer operated by Russian-backed separatists.\n\nOminous warnings. Russia called the strike a destabilizing act that violated the cease-fire agreement, raising fears of a new intervention in Ukraine that could draw the United States and Europe into a new phase of the conflict.\n\nThe Kremlin's position. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has increasingly portrayed NATO's eastward expansion as an existential threat to his country, said that Moscow's military buildup was a response to Ukraine's deepening partnership with the alliance.\n\nRising tension. Western countries have tried to maintain a dialogue with Moscow. But administration officials recently warned that the U.S. could throw its weight behind a Ukrainian insurgency should Russia invade.\n\nDuring the meeting at Camp David, Mr. Austin and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared by video from the Pentagon and from General Milley's quarters, where he has been quarantining since he tested positive for the coronavirus. Officials said that if Mr. Biden approved the deployment, some of the troops would come from the United States, while others would move from other parts of Europe to the more vulnerable countries on NATO's eastern flank.\n\nAmerican officials did not describe in detail the ground troop reinforcements under review, but current and former commanders said they should include more air defense, engineering, logistics and artillery forces.\n\nBesides the troops, Mr. Biden could also approve sending additional aircraft to the region.\n\nRepresentative Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday that the United States also needed to conduct more training in those NATO nations.\n\n\"We need joint exercises in Poland, the Baltic States, Romania, Bulgaria, to show Putin that we're serious,\" Mr. McCaul said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"Right now, he doesn't see we're serious.\"\n\nAccording to Poland's defense ministry, there are currently about 4,000 U.S. troops and 1,000 other NATO troops stationed in Poland. There are also about 4,000 NATO troops in the Baltic States.\n\nThe United States has been regularly flying Air Force RC-135 Rivet Joint electronic-eavesdropping planes over Ukraine since late December. The planes allow American intelligence operatives to listen to Russian ground commanders' communications. The Air Force is also flying E-8 JSTARS ground-surveillance planes to track the Russian troop buildup and the movements of the forces.\n\nThe Biden administration is especially interested in any indication that Russia may deploy tactical nuclear weapons to the border, a move that Russian officials have suggested could be an option.\n\nMore than 150 U.S. military advisers are in Ukraine, trainers who have for years worked out of the training ground near Lviv, in the country's west, far from the front lines. The current group includes Special Operations forces, mostly Army Green Berets, as well as National Guard trainers from Florida's 53rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team.\n\nMilitary advisers from about a dozen allied countries are also in Ukraine, U.S. officials said. Several NATO countries, including Britain, Canada, Lithuania and Poland, have regularly sent training forces to the country.\n\nIn the event of a full-scale Russian invasion, the United States intends to move its military trainers out of the country quickly. But it is possible that some Americans could stay to advise Ukrainian officials in Kyiv, the capital, or provide frontline support, a U.S. official said.\n\nKatie Benner, Edward Wong and Lara Jakes contributed reporting.",

            "body": "South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem explains to 'Hannity' viewers why President Biden is failing at his job.\n\nWhen it comes to both foreign policy and his liberal energy agenda, President Joe Biden has embarrassed our nation. I can sum up President Biden's incompetence in these areas with one simple story: a tale of two pipelines.\n\nOn one hand, Biden blocked the crucial Keystone XL Pipeline, signaling to the world that American energy independence is no longer a priority. On the other hand, he green-lit the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, strengthening Russia's energy hold on Europe. And in the process, he gave Russia the leverage to create the crisis that we are witnessing unfold in Ukraine. Let me begin with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Biden's policy failure on that score.\n\nRUSSIA'S LONG GAME ON UKRAINE, ENERGY AND EUROPE\n\nUntil last year, getting tough on Russia was one of the few issues that seemed to unite conservatives and progressives. When I served on the House Armed Services Committee, my colleagues all recognized the real threat that Russia poses to our nation. In 2019, Congress passed a bipartisan measure to impose sanctions on the Russian company that is building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to deliver natural gas from Russia to Germany. The sanctions had strong support from both Democrat leadership and the Trump administration.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed the sanctions into law after pointing out that the pipeline \"really makes Germany a hostage of Russia if things ever happened that were bad.\" He wanted to contain the Russians, not empower them to overrun Europe.\n\nMaintaining Trump's sanctions should have been an easy call for President Biden. Polish President Andrzej Duda told Trump that he fiercely opposed Nord Stream 2. The head of Naftogaz, a Ukrainian energy company, called the pipeline Russia's most \"dangerous geopolitical project.\" And thanks to America becoming a net exporter of energy during President Trump's administration, the United States had created the capacity to sell our gas to European allies and reduce the reliance on Russian energy.\n\nHowever, last May, the Biden administration waived those bipartisan sanctions, allowing Nord Stream to move forward. In doing so, they handed away leverage to the Russians and doomed Ukraine in the process.\n\nRUSSIA-UKRAINE CRISIS - IT'S TIME FOR BIDEN TO SURPRISE PUTIN\n\nSome theorize that President Biden simply reversed an important accomplishment of the Trump administration for spite. A more sinister theory suggests that because his son, Hunter Biden, served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, President Biden had, at a minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest. To make matters worse, Hunter \"received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow,\" according to a Congressional report.\n\nIt is impossible to say for certain whether such a conflict exists. But leaders of both parties were sure that blocking this Russian pipeline was the right thing to do. And by allowing it to move forward, the United States lost vital leverage over Moscow. Biden is now scrambling to regain this leverage he lost, but it is too little, too late. His new sanctions come after Russian troops have already moved into Ukraine. Unfortunately, it appears the damage is done.\n\nI hope that Biden will someday explain why Canadian oil causes global warming, but Russian gas doesn't.\n\nWhat makes Biden's approach to Nord Stream 2 so much worse is the fact that he took a completely opposite approach to the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have benefitted my home state of South Dakota and our entire nation. On his first day as President, Biden blocked Keystone XL from moving forward. This pipeline would have been able to deliver more than 800,000 daily barrels of Canadian crude to refineries on the Gulf Coast.\n\nIn South Dakota, we were ready to complete construction of Keystone XL. The project would have brought thousands of jobs to our state, would have provided property tax revenues to our small towns for years, and would have lowered gas prices for Americans across the country.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nUnfortunately, President Biden took a shortsighted approach to appease his liberal base. Americans are seeing the results at the pump. Gas prices continue to rise. And we have lost our ability to counter Russian energy policy because we are significantly weakened from an energy production standpoint.\n\nHere in South Dakota, high gas prices are hurting everyone. It is a long way to drive anywhere in our rural state. Our long, cold winter is far from over. And thanks to Biden's inflation, fuel costs continue to rise. Keystone would have helped ease those fears while giving America the flexibility to counter Russian aggression by expanding energy exports to Europe. I hope that Biden will someday explain why Canadian oil causes global warming, but Russian gas doesn't.\n\nTrust in leaders is a key element of a dependable foreign policy. Just as important as the actual policy is confidence in the person making decisions at the top.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden lost the confidence of the American people thanks to the chaotic manner in which he withdrew American troops from Afghanistan. As bad as the optics were in Afghanistan, the current Ukraine crisis may be worse because he is emboldening Russia, our longtime geopolitical foe.\n\nIn this tale of the two pipelines, President Biden's disastrous foreign policy and energy agenda intersect. His twin failures are putting our nation, and the entire free world, at risk.",

            "body": "WASHINGTON -- First, he said he was \"working and cooperating with\" government agents who he claimed had inappropriately entered his home. Then, when the government revealed that the FBI, during its search, had recovered nearly a dozen sets of documents that were marked classified, he suggested the agents had planted evidence.\n\nFinally, his aides claimed that he had a \"standing order\" to declassify documents that left the Oval Office for his residence and that some of the material was protected by attorney-client and executive privilege.\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\nThose are the ever shifting explanations that former President Donald Trump and his aides have given regarding what FBI agents found last week in a search of his residence at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nTrump and his allies have cast the search as a partisan assault while amplifying conflicting arguments about the handling of sensitive documents and failing to answer a question at the center of the federal investigation: Why was he keeping documents, some still marked classified, at an unsecured Florida resort when officials had sought for a year to retrieve them?\n\nThe often contradictory and unsupported defenses perpetuated by Trump and his team since the FBI search follow a familiar playbook of the former president's. He has used it over decades but most visibly when he was faced with the investigation into whether his campaign in 2016 conspired with Russians and during his first impeachment trial.\n\nIn both instances, he claimed victimization and mixed some facts with a blizzard of misleading statements or falsehoods. His lawyers denied he had tied his administration's withholding of vital military aid to Ukraine to Trump's desire for investigations into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nWhen information contradicting that defense emerged in a forthcoming book by Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton, Trump's lawyers switched to insisting that he hadn't connected the aid to the investigations, but that if he had, it wouldn't have been an impeachable offense.\n\nOf the multiple investigations Trump currently faces -- including a state inquiry in Georgia and two federal grand jury investigations, all related to his efforts to cling to power at the end of his presidency, as well as civil and criminal inquiries in New York related to his company -- the federal investigation into his handling of sensitive documents taken from the White House has emerged as one of the most potentially damaging.\n\nA search warrant made public Friday revealed federal agents had recovered top secret documents when they searched Trump's Florida residence earlier in the week as part of an investigation into possible violations of the Espionage Act and other laws.\n\nAmong the 11 sets of documents taken were some marked as \"classified/TS/SCI\" -- shorthand for \"top secret/sensitive compartmented information,\" according to an inventory of the materials seized in the search. Those types of documents are meant to be viewed only in secure facilities. The inventory of documents included other material, some described as \"confidential.\"\n\nThe stunning revelation made clear the gravity of the Justice Department's inquiry months after the National Archives and Records Administration said it had discovered classified information in documents that Trump had held onto after leaving office.\n\n\"What he doesn't have the right to do is possess the documents; they are not his,\" said Jason Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives for more than a decade. \"There should be no presidential records at Mar-a-Lago, whether they are classified or unclassified or subject to executive privilege or subject to attorney-client privilege.\"\n\nDocuments covered by executive privilege are meant to be kept within the government.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nTrump used Hillary Rodham Clinton's mishandling of classified material, as seen in a Justice Department investigation into her email practices in 2015 and 2016, as political fodder during his first campaign. He is considering another national campaign for 2024, and questions about whether he mishandled the nation's secrets could be problematic for him, even absent an investigation.\n\nAfter officials with the National Archives tried for several months to retrieve material from Trump, he turned over 15 boxes of documents in January. The next month, the National Archives confirmed the discovery of the classified information and referred the matter to the Justice Department.\n\nOver the following months, officials came to learn that Trump still had additional material at Mar-a-Lago that some of his advisers urged him to hand over.\n\nTrump described the handover of the 15 boxes as \"an ordinary and routine process.\" But administrations have been required to turn over documents to the National Archives before leaving office for more than 40 years, as part of the Presidential Records Act that was created in response to President Richard Nixon's attempt to take his documents and recordings with him after resigning in disgrace.\n\nKash Patel, a former Trump administration official, subsequently justified the handling of the documents by saying Trump had declassified them before leaving office -- a claim echoed by Trump last week.\n\nIn an appearance on Fox News on Friday night, right-wing writer John Solomon, one of Trump's representatives for interacting with the National Archives, read a statement from the former president's office asserting Trump had a \"standing order\" during his presidency that \"documents removed from the Oval Office and taken to the residence were deemed to be declassified the moment he removed them.\"\n\nThat claim would not resolve the investigation. Two of the laws referred to in the search warrant executed last week criminalize the taking or concealment of government records, regardless of whether they had anything to do with national security. And laws against taking material with restricted national security information are not dependent on whether the material is technically classified.\n\nBolton, who served as Trump's third national security adviser over 17 months, said he had never heard of the standing order that Trump's office claimed to have in place. It is, he said, \"almost certainly a lie.\"\n\n\"I was never briefed on any such order, procedure, policy when I came in,\" Bolton said, adding he had never been told of it while he was working there and had never heard of such a thing after. \"If he were to say something like that, you would have to memorialize that, so that people would know it existed,\" he said.\n\nWhat's more, he pointed out, secure facilities for viewing sensitive material were constructed at Trump's clubs in Florida and New Jersey, where he often spent weekends as president, meaning that the documents wouldn't need to be declassified. And if they were declassified, Bolton said, they would be considered subject to public-record requests.\n\nHe added: \"When somebody begins to concoct lies like this, it shows a real level of desperation.\"\n\nThe claim that the documents held in the Florida residence were declassified also undercut an assertion one of Trump's lawyers made in June. In a written declaration, the lawyer's team said all material marked as classified and stored at Mar-a-Lago had been returned to the government.\n\nLast week, Trump again accused the Justice Department of acting as a tool for his political opponents, a familiar tactic for a former president who had tried repeatedly to politicize the department during his four years in office. Describing the FBI as corrupt, Trump suggested that its agents had planted incriminating material at Mar-a-Lago during the search, and he demanded they return documents that he said were protected by executive privilege.\n\nSuch accusations of political motivation prompted Attorney General Merrick Garland to defend the bureau's agents during brief remarks last week. Trump's unverified accusations also came as the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security last week issued an intelligence bulletin that warned of an increase in threats against federal law enforcement after the search of Mar-a-Lago, including general calls for a \"civil war\" or \"armed rebellion.\"",

To qualify, Ukrainians must have been in the United States by Aug. 16, two days before the announcement. They are eligible for work authorization.\n\nREAD MORE: Ukrainian refugees find safety, but not peace, nearly a year after Russian invasion\n\nThe temporary status was originally scheduled to expire on Oct. 19, 2023 but is being extended 18 months to April 19, 2025.\n\n\"Russia's ongoing military invasion of Ukraine and the resulting humanitarian crisis requires that the United States continue to offer safety and protection to Ukrainians who may not be able to return to their country,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nThe expansion comes as the administration extends Temporary Protected Status to people from a growing number of countries, including Cameroon, Haiti and Venezuela, as part of a carrot-and-stick approach to immigration that combines more legal entries on humanitarian grounds with more punitive measures against anyone who enters the country illegally.\n\nA 1990 law allows the Homeland Security secretary to grant status in increments of up to 18 months to people already in the United States whose countries are struck by civil strife or natural disaster and are considered unsafe for return.\n\nUkrainians first got Temporary Protected Status immediately after Russia's invasion. The administration added humanitarian parole for those not in the United States, a move that it considered so successful that it later did the same for people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.\n\nFriday's announcement gives additional time to Ukrainians whose two-year parole was due to expire early next year.\n\nREAD MORE: Hispanic Democrats send letter urging Biden administration to investigate Texas' separation of migrant fathers\n\nCubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans face more uncertainty.\n\nTexas and other Republican-led states are challenging parole for up to 30,000 people a month from those four countries but is not contesting status for Ukrainians.

            "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration announced on Thursday it would offer humanitarian relief to Ukrainians who have been living in the country without legal documentation since March 1 or earlier, signaling additional support for citizens of Ukraine as Russia advanced in the south of the country.\n\nCanada announced similar relief on Thursday, as did the European Union, which said it would offer three years of protection for Ukrainian refugees.The United Nations predicted that 10 million Ukrainians, about a quarter of the country's population, could be displaced by the Russian invasion. Already, a million people have fled the country as refugees.\n\nLawmakers and advocacy groups have been calling for the relief, known as temporary protected status. Some have estimated that 28,000 to 30,000 Ukrainians could be eligible for it; the designation gives them permission to stay and work in the United States for 18 months. Often, temporary protected status is extended. In this case, it will not apply to any Ukrainians who entered the country after March 1.\n\n\"Russia's premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,\" Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement.\n\nThe Biden administration moved quickly on the designation, even as advocates have been pleading with the government for months to offer similar relief to people from Cameroon, who have faced violence and persecution when they were not granted asylum in the United States and deported.\n\nDaniel Tse, the founder of the Cameroon Advocacy Network, said he saw a racial component to the decisions.\n\n\"It is evidence of anti-blackness and discrimination toward Black immigrants,\" Mr. Tse said on Thursday, echoing a growing concern among immigration advocates and some lawmakers.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which decides when to grant temporary protected status in close coordination with the White House, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Previously, Mr. Mayorkas has said that the immigration system treats all migrants equally.\n\nBoth Republican and Democratic lawmakers have called for the administration to offer the benefit to Ukrainians.\n\n\"Ukrainian Nationals currently in the United States should not be forced to return to Ukraine while the nation is at war with Russia,\" Sen. Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said on Twitter. \"Granting them Temporary Protected Status is the right thing to do.\"\n\nLive Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 3, 2022, 6:32 p.m. ETU.S. will allow some Ukrainians to stay in the country temporarily.The European Union offers three-year protection for Ukrainian refugees.Times photographers document Ukraine under attack.\n\nSenator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, praised the administration for giving this relief to Ukrainians. But he also urged the White House to designate citizens of Cameroon, Ethiopia and Afghanistan as eligible for the same benefit.\n\n\"Temporary Protected Status was created by Congress for exactly this purpose -- to protect people whose home countries have experienced armed conflict, an environmental disaster or extraordinary conditions that prevent people from safely returning home,\" Mr. Menendez said in a statement. The program went into effect in 1990.\n\nThe administration also paused deportations on commercial flights to the region, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. On March 1, three Ukrainians were scheduled for deportation to Kyiv on a commercial flight, the official said. Those three people are now eligible to apply for temporary status.\n\nRussia-Ukraine War: Key Things to KnowCard 1 of 4\n\nA Ukrainian city falls.

The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the support of 141 countries out of 193. The vote, which is not legally binding, reflected Russia's growing isolation on the international stage.\n\nMore than 1,000 Ukrainians were caught crossing the southwest border of the United States from October to January, a significant increase compared with previous years, according to government data.\n\nThere are currently more than 400,000 people living in the United States under temporary protected status, including immigrants from Burma, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.\n\nAdvocates for limiting immigration have been critical of the program, which they say ultimately lets people who receive the designation stay in the United States permanently.\n\nThe federal agency that handles applications for the temporary benefit reports about a six-month wait period.

            "body": "AUSTIN, TX - House Republicans are seeking a hearing to investigate how the Biden administration released a suspected Islamist terrorist into the United States after being stopped crossing the southern border illegally.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, sent a request to House Democrats requesting authorization to hold the hearing, writing:\n\n\"There is no known case in which a foreign national who pinged on a terror watch list was simply released on his own recognizance.\n\n\"The facts in the case strongly suggest that the Biden Administration failed to follow appropriate protocols with respect to suspected terrorists.\"\n\nThe letter sent to subcommittee Chair Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) was signed by eight Republican subcommittee members.\n\nDemocrats are unlikely to permit the hearing, and one aide to Rep. Biggs told The Federalist, \"They're ignoring us.\"\n\nThe request came following revelations that a Lebanese from Venezuela crossed the border from Mexico into the United States and was released from custody into the interior despite being on the FBI terrorist watchlist.\n\n\"The Biden administration has allowed Issam Bazzi, who was caught wading along the shores of the Rio Grande River in Texas last November, to be released on his own recognizance while he awaits a March asylum hearing in Detroit.\n\n\"According to sensitive government documents obtained exclusively by Deadline Detroit, Bazzi and his family are living, presumably, in Dearborn in a house owned by his cousin on a tree-lined street near Wyoming and Warren Avenues.\"\n\nBazzi crossed the border in November with a rush of other Venezuelans swimming the Rio Grande after President Biden promised leniency for illegal aliens.\n\nReportedly, Bazzi flew to Monterrey, Mexico with his wife and daughter before crossing the river into Brownsville, Texas.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection intercepted Bazzi afterhe crossed. During processing, his fingerprints and name revealed he was on the terrorist watchlist. According to CBP documents, Bazzi was a classified as a \"Category 5 group member, \"meaning he was not considered armed and dangerous.\n\nCBP protocols require that the FBI interrogate any border crossers found to be on the watch list, and then should be detained in CBP detention until removed back to their country of origin. Although deportation to Venezuela would not have been possible because of cuts in diplomatic ties, he could have been flown to Columbia under a new agreement.\n\nThe FBI recommended Bazzi be detained, and agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement classified him as a flight risk.\n\nShockingly, the Department of Homeland Security ignored these recommendations, and instead released him into the interior U.S. The administration reportedly released him from detention because of COVID-19 concerns, because Bazzi was considered high risk because he had the \"chronic care condition\" of being overweight, according to leaked Department of Homeland Security documents uncovered by LeDuff.\n\nAccording to the same leaked documents, Bazzi is described as a person with \"high derogatory information\" with ties to an unspecified terror group. Disregarding these facts, DHS released him and his family on December 9 with a promise he would show up for an immigration asylum hearing in March.\n\nAndrew Arena, former chief of international terrorism operations for the FBI, said the release made no sense, but was the result of the Biden administration's lax immigration stance:\n\n\"Unless there's something bigger going on, we don't let people in who are on the list.\n\n\"This appears to be the new and improved border security posture. A kinder, gentler approach. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense. And quite frankly, I've never seen it before.\"\n\nChris Cabrera, vice-president of the Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol agents, said the public should be concerned about people gaining access to the United States through the southern border:\n\n\"The public would be shocked to learn of very bad people who are being apprehended at the border and ultimately released into the United States.\n\n\"But the terror watch list? That's the top of the top. The worst of the worst.\"\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - Amid a U.S. border crisis, President Biden is diverting Customs and Border Protection officers from the strained United States southern border to send overseas to help at the Ukrainian border.\n\nA memo issued by the CBP' office of field operations requested border patrol volunteers to be immediately deployed to Poland in support of \"Operation Ukraine Support,\" according to a report by Just The News.\n\nThe memo sent to field operations executives stated:\n\n\"The Office of Field Operations is seeking volunteers to assist with the possible evacuation of U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and their immediate family members from Ukraine.\n\n\"Eligible employees who volunteer for this situation may be selected to serve a temporary duty assignment in Poland to facilitate travelers for entry into the U.S., to include providing guidance and problems resolution to other government agencies.\"\n\nAs international humanitarian groups warned that the Russian invasion could trigger a major exodus from Ukraine, some refugee resettlement leaders in the United States called on the Biden administration to prepare to welcome people fleeing the war.\n\nDavid Duea, president of Lutheran Community Services Northwest, called resettling Ukrainian refuges inside the U.S. a \"moral imperative\":\n\n\"It will be our moral imperative to welcome Ukrainian refugees, as we have been doing for decades.\"\n\nHowever, the U.S. refugee program has been strained beyond limits trying to place 70,000 evacuees from Afghanistan following the disastrous pull out from the war-torn country in August.\n\nBill Frelick, director of the refugee and migrant rights division of Human Rights Watch, said funding cuts during the Trump administration have left nonprofits involved in resettlement, and that keeping refugees overseas would be a better solution:\n\n\"Right now, our resettlement capacity, which was decimated under the Trump administration, is strained to the limits.\n\nEstablishing camps, if needed in places like Poland, would be a much higher imperative than planning for refugee resettlement at this emergency stage.\"\n\nResettling Ukrainian refugees inside the U.S. is also complicated by the failed Afghan resettlement program, which has been widely criticized for allowing at least 50 individuals posing \"potentially significant security concerns.\"\n\nIn addition, the Defense Department Inspector General informed Congress earlier this month that 28 out of 31 Afghan evacuees with known \"derogatory information\" can no longer be located:\n\n\"Not being able to locate Afghan evacuees with derogatory information quickly and accurately could pose a security risk to the United States. In addition, the U.S. government could mistakenly grant ineligible Afghan evacuees with derogatory information (parole into the country).\n\n\"Significant security concerns include individuals whose latent fingerprints have been found on improvised explosive devices and known or suspected terrorists.\"\n\nIn addition to those concerns, pulling Border Patrol agents from the U.S./Mexico border will further stretch U.S. immigration enforcement capabilities at a time when about 2.1 million border crossers and illegal aliens are expected at the border this year.\n\nIn January, the Border Patrol apprehended nearly 154,000 border crossers as the Biden administration signalled lax immigration enforcement and calls for leniency for border crossers.\n\nThe administration has re-enacted the catch-and-release process that was ended by former President Donald Trump. The Biden administration released more than 62,500 border crossers into the U.S. just last month.\n\nIn a leaked audiotape obtained by Townhall, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the immigration crisis in the United States was the worst it has been in two decades:\n\n\"Look, it's worse now than it, frankly, has been in at least 20 years, if not ever.\"\n\nSteven Kopits with Princeton Policy Advisors, predicted that this year's immigration crisis would outpace last year under the Biden administration:\n\n\"Given the comparatively steady pace of apprehensions, we might expect recent experience under the Biden administration to continue.\n\n\"Under such circumstances, we forecast 2.1 million apprehensions for both calendar year and fiscal year 2022, both records besting not only all other administrations but even the Biden administration's disastrous first year.\"",

            "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Thursday committed $800 million in additional military aid to Ukraine and rolled out a process for the U.S. to welcome Ukrainian refugees displaced by the war beginning next week.\n\nBiden also said he will ban Russian ships from U.S. ports, following the European Union and other countries that have imposed a similar ban.\n\nIn remarks from the White House's Roosevelt Room, Biden said the additional military aid will ensure a steady flow of weapons and equipment into Ukraine over the next few weeks and send an unmistakable message to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"He will never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine,\" Biden said.\n\nMore: 'Speak softly and carry a large Javelin': Biden unveils latest $800M military aid package. Ukraine updates\n\nThe latest infusion of security assistance, which matches a military drawdown of the same amount last week, includes 72 howitzers, 72 truck to tow them, 121 Phoenix Ghost drones, other heavy artillery weapons and 144,000 rounds of ammunition. Biden said the aid will \"further augment Ukraine's ability\" to fight Russian attacks in the eastern Ukrainian Donbas region.\n\n\"We're in a critical window now of time, where they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,\" Biden said\n\nThe assistance brings the total U.S. aid to Ukraine during Biden's presidency to about $4 billion. That includes $3.4 billion since Putin invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Biden said he's nearly exhausted the level of aid authorized by Congress last month and will seek approval of a future supplemental budget request.\n\nAhead of his remarks, Biden met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyha at the White House. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly pushed Western allies, particularly the U.S., to provide more aid amid allegations that Putin directed war crimes and genocide.\n\nHow much aid has US given to Ukraine? US military aid to Ukraine surpasses $3 billion under Biden. Here's what's been provided\n\nBiden said his administration is \"not sitting on\" funds for Ukraine approved by Congress and that it's going directly to the \"frontlines of freedom.\" He said not all assistance is advertised.\n\n\"Sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin, because we're sending a lot of those in as well,\" Biden said, taking about surface-to-air Javelin missiles and playing off a famous like from President Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nBiden also announced $500 million in direct economic assistance to the Ukrainian government. His remarks came as Putin claimed victory in the heavily contested Ukrainian city of Mariupol in the eastern Donbas region. Biden pushed back against Putin's claims in response to a question from a reporter.\n\n\"It's questionable whether he does control Mariupol,\" said Biden, who departed on a presidential swing through Portland, Oregon, and Seattle after his speech. \"There's no evidence yet that Mariupol has completely fallen.\"\n\nUkrainians displaced by the war in their country will be allowed to seek temporary refuge in the United States under a new program the Biden administration announced Thursday.\n\nBiden has promised the U.S. would accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees who fled their homeland after it was invaded by Russian forces.\n\nStarting next week, U.S. citizens and groups will be able to apply to sponsor Ukraine refugees under the Uniting for Ukraine program. They can apply through an online portal that will be available on the Department of Homeland Security website starting April 25.\n\nKiev or Kyiv? 'We want to use our own names': Language experts explain importance of Ukrainian cities' spellings\n\nUkrainians who are given permission to travel to the U.S. under the program will undergo a streamlined approval process that will allow them to live and work in the United States for up to two years.\n\nTo qualify, they must have been a resident of Ukraine as of Feb. 11 and have a U.S sponsor. They also will be required to undergo a background check, pass biometric screenings, complete vaccinations and meet other public health requirements.\n\nSponsors must undergo background screenings to make sure they are able to support the refugees and won't exploit or abuse them.\n\nBiden said the program will complement existing legal pathways available to Ukrainians, such as immigrant visas and refugee processing, and will provide an expedited channel for Ukrainians who have a U.S. sponsor to secure legal migration from Europe to the United States.\n\n\"This program will be fast, it will be streamlined and it will ensure the United States honors its commitment to the people of Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nRefugee tracker: Millions of refugees are fleeing Ukraine. Where are they going?\n\nThe vetting process for refugees is expected to take about a week, said senior officials with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council, who described the program on the condition of anonymity.\n\nIt has taken weeks for the administration to lay out a plan to accept the refugees -- leaving thousands of refugees in limbo as they tried to map their next move after fleeing their home country amid attacks from Russia.\n\nThe delay also led to some Ukrainians heading to the U.S.-Mexico border to try and seek asylum. Title 42, which allows U.S. border agents to expel asylum seekers to Mexico to prevent the spread of coronavirus, is still in place. However, there are exceptions to the policy and some Ukrainians were able to be processed to come to the United States.\n\nUkrainians and southern border: Refugees from Ukraine wait in Tijuana for permission to enter US\n\nThe U.S. has processed close to 15,000 undocumented Ukrainian nationals over the past three months, most of them entering the country through the border with Mexico, the officials said.\n\nLast month, 5,071 Ukrainian people were detained while entering the United States at land, sea or air borders last month, according to data from Customs and Border Protection. That was up from 1,146 Ukrainians who were detained in February. Many of the Ukrainians who were detained last month came through the United States' southern border.\n\nThe administration earlier this year announced deportation protections to Ukrainians already in the United States.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security granted temporary protected status to Ukrainians in early March. On Monday, the agency extended eligibility for the program, allowing those who arrived by April 11 to apply for TPS, which allows them to stay in the United States for 18 months and apply for work permits.\n\nBack into Ukraine: 'We believe in the Ukrainian army': Historic flood of refugees slows as some decide to stay put\n\nBiden's ban on Russian ships from entering U.S. ports follows a series of escalating economic sanctions on Russia in retaliation for the war in Ukraine.\n\nNo ship that sails under the Russian flag or that is owned or operated by Russian interests will be allowed to dock in a U.S. port or access U.S. shores, Biden said during remarks from the Roosevelt Room in the White House.\n\nBiden said the ban would further deny Russia \"the benefits of international economic system that they so enjoyed in the past.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the European Union banned Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels from accessing ports in its 27-nation bloc but provided exemptions for agricultural and food products, humanitarian aid and energy. The United Kingdom and Canada also have banned Russian ships from their ports.",

            "body": "CHICAGO -- When the Russian rockets started flying over his region of Ukraine, Nazar Volianiuk, his wife and three kids hastily packed clothes, piled into two cars and fled to the Polish border.\n\nThey waited two frightening days in line at a crossing clogged with refugees, scrambling for cover in a roadside forest amid the scream of air raid sirens.\n\nLike many who fled Russia's invasion a year ago, Volianiuk, 31, and his wife Natalia, 32, figured it would be safe to return to their home in Lutsk, Ukraine, after a few months.\n\nToday, Volianiuk is settled in a tidy suburban apartment outside of Chicago, with a cable company job, young kids in school and a supportive community - and no desire to return to Ukraine, even when the conflict ends.\n\n\"No chance,\" he said, drinking tea in his Chicago apartment on a recent day. \"We want to stay here.\"\n\nOne year after Russia's invasion sparked Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II, more than 8 million refugees remain scattered in Europe, the U.S. and beyond. As the conflict they fled grinds on, their new roots grow deeper.\n\nAmid new jobs, languages and lives hangs a consequential question: Not just when to go home, but whether.\n\nHow many ultimately return to Ukraine is a question with important ramifications: for refugees, including those with temporary immigration status; for host countries that see tensions as new residents add to their workforce but strain their housing and schools; and for Ukraine's capacity to rebuild its country and economy.\n\nA United Nations survey that included 43 countries, published in September, found that 81% of refugees hoped to return to Ukraine one day, though most said they plan for now to stay in their host countries.\n\nBut as the war drags on, the impetus to return is likely to diminish, experts say.\n\n\"The longer it lasts, the greater chance that people really start to envision and build up a life (outside of Ukraine) and not go back,\" said Hanne Beirens, who heads the Migration Policy Institute of Europe.\n\nLast year, a European Commission official estimated up to 3 million might decide to stay in other countries in Europe, while other estimates put the total number of Ukrainians settling elsewhere at 5 million or even more.\n\nBut accurate forecasts are difficult given the unknowns as the war marks a grim milestone, including an apparent new Russian offensive and a recent poll showing declining U.S. public support for military aid to Ukraine.\n\nFor now, millions of displaced Ukrainians living abroad - including more than a quarter-million in the U.S. - are left in limbo as they grapple with questions about their future.\n\n\"We are hearing, 'Yes, We'd like to go back, but what are we going back to?\" said Dylanna Grasinger, director of U.S. field offices for the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, which provides services to Ukrainians. \"One day it's yes, the next day it's no.\"\n\nMore: Ukraine-Russia war has scattered families worldwide. Hear their stories of survival.\n\nMore: War crimes in Ukraine may be unprecedented. So is the country's push for swift justice.\n\nOn a recent February day, Diana Guloz was getting ready for a yoga class in her small German town, a key respite from caring for her infant child and war's traumas.\n\nGuloz, 35, a language teacher from Kyiv, was pregnant when she fled to Bucha after the war began, only to find herself in the middle of a battle that led to Russia's takeover of the town.\n\nPraying in a basement as fighting raged, she then spent a terrifying few weeks in a city without electricity and gas, scared each day of being shot or raped. A slew of civilian deaths later sparked war crimes investigations.\n\nWhen Russian troops finally retreated, she fled to Germany, which was among the European nations that provided temporary protection and help with housing, health care, language courses and work permits.\n\nIn the town of Stralsund -- at the edge of the Baltic Sea, a thousand miles from her home -- she gave birth to her son, Ellis.\n\nLike Guloz, most of the more than 1 million Ukrainians who arrived in Germany are women with children. In Ukraine, men of certain ages are barred from leaving the country because of the war.\n\nGrateful for the welcome refuge, she said she never thought she'd be in Germany for the last 11 months. More recently, she said, some Ukrainians have seen anecdotal signs of resentment emerge. Some fellow refugees' children struggle to be accepted at school.\n\nShe's working to learn German and find work, but life there can feel at times like the \"backside of the moon.\"\n\n\"I want to go back to Ukraine as soon as possible,\" she said.\n\nBut some others plan to stay, including some who lost homes or worry about their ability to thrive economically once the war ends.\n\nAn October survey in Germany for the research group EconPol Europe found that 21% said they didn't intend to return to Ukraine, and 27% said they weren't sure. Only 6% planned to return soon.\n\n\"A large share of Ukrainians will not be ready, or willing, to return for quite some time,\" analysts wrote in their study of the poll.\n\nGuloz is not sure what will happen when legal permission to stay in EU member states expires in March 2024, though it could be extended again.\n\nWhile some feel safe enough in Kyiv, she said, her brother told her that a bomb landed recently, close to his apartment. It was a reminder of her own post-traumatic stress that still lingers, another force keeping her from going back right now.\n\n\"I remember the worst days,' she said of the Bucha battles and Russian occupation. \"There are a lot of pictures in my imagination.\"\n\nUkrainians Nataliia Lukashevych, 22, and her colleague, Yuliia Fedyk, 25, spend their days in Warsaw, Poland helping refugees reach the United States.\n\nPoland has taken in 1.5 million Ukrainians, the most of any nation - many of whom were greeted with help from hot meals at the border to housing -- as well as health insurance, education and other benefits.\n\nSome had connections in Poland, long a destination for Ukrainian migrant workers. While the influx has bolstered the labor force, it has also strained housing and schools.\n\n\"Living conditions in Poland are not very comfortable. With very low salaries, housing prices are simply exorbitant. People.... sometimes cannot meet their basic needs,\" Lukashevych said, explaining why some want to reach the U.S. for the chance to earn more money.\n\nIn March, refugees will have to begin to pay half of government housing costs after 4 months, a fraction that will later rise. Still, one poll found that 27% of Ukrainians plan to stay for good, even after the war.\n\nLukashevych and Fedyk work for American Service in Ukraine, a small nonprofit that matches Ukrainians with U.S. sponsors in Minnesota and then supports them with jobs and other aid.\n\nMany reach out to them on Telegram in messages that underscore the suffering driving people to flee Ukraine: People without heat or electricity. Workers who are unable to earn money. Residents exhausted by air raids. Parents seeking a safe life for their children. Women journeying alone as their husbands fight in the war.\n\nLukashevych said most want to stay in the U.S. permanently.\n\nOn Jan. 10, one of those messages arrived from a 42-year-old man named Buryi Mykhailo. He was an Army veteran and former coal plant worker from Donetsk, he wrote, but was forced to flee in 2014 during fighting with pro-Russian separatists.\n\nHe and his girlfriend moved to Vasylkiv, in central Ukraine. The day Russia invaded last year, he woke at 5 a.m. to explosions as an airfield in the town was bombed. The couple fled again, and two days later, a shell destroyed their home.\n\nThey finally reached western Ukraine, and with Lukashevych and Fedyk's help, planned to buy his flight to the U.S. in February.\n\n\"We are fleeing the war for the second time and have been living out of our suitcases,\" he wrote in the message.\n\nMykhailo told Lukashevych that he still wants to be able to visit relatives in Ukraine and Europe. But the priority, he said, is to stay legally in the United States and build a new life.\n\nSofiia Rudenko, 22, spends her days in constant motion, helping newly arrived Ukrainians in Minneapolis who need housing, furniture, groceries and a ride to job interviews.\n\nA university student in Ukraine when the war started, she reached the U.S. and now works with ASIU, which provides full resettlement support for sponsors of Ukrainians. So far, she's among more than 50 to have arrived in Minneapolis with the non-profit's support.\n\n\"Nobody expected the war to be this long,\" she said. Now, \"everyone can see it's not going end the in near future.\"\n\nAbout 110,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the U.S. as part of the Biden Administration's Uniting for Ukraine program, which grants humanitarian parole for displaced Ukrainians who have a U.S. sponsor. About 35,000 have been approved for arrival, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAnd151,000 Ukrainians have entered the United States through other immigration channels since March 24 last year, a DHS spokesman said.\n\nThe U.S, has gotten more than 200,000 requests agreeing to support Ukrainian parolees as part of Uniting for Ukraine, ranging from individual families and churches to nonprofits and other groups.\n\nWhile it has often worked well, some individuals have found themselves overwhelmed by the needs, said Chris George, who heads Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services, a refugee resettlement agency in Connecticut.\n\nIn Minneapolis, some of the Ukrainian arrivals, many well-educated, work for employers including Home Depot, which allows them to send money to relatives in Ukraine. Rudenko herself has sent battery banks and electric blankets to her family.\n\nWhat their future holds is less clear, said Aswar Raham, who started the organization. That includes being uncertain what happens when their parole status expires in two years.\n\nAnd many aren't sure whether they will return, even once they decide it's safe enough or the war ends. Right now, it's difficult to make any plans.\n\n\"The uncertainty built into all this is just incomprehensible,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, many Ukrainians in Minnesota want to go back, he said, but it's complicated. He cited one couple with a young child. They are thriving, earning a middle-class salary. But they're likely to face an agonizing dilemma at some point in the future.\n\n\"They're going to have to make the call in a few years to decide whether they go back to their country to rebuild&mldr;or stay here for the sake of her daughter's education and her future,\" he said.\n\nInside Volianiuk's ground-floor apartment not far from the Chicago airport, pairs of children's shoes sit near the door. In one bedroom, Olena, 9, Oleksandr, and Maksymm 3, played on the floor.\n\nWhile most men are barred from emigrating, Volianiuk said allowed to leave Ukraine because he has three children. After months in Poland, he was admitted to the U.S. in the fall under a program that allows members of religious minorities in former Soviet Union countries to join U.S. family members.\n\nHe was among the many Ukrainians who were already seeking to migrate before the war, hoping to provide a better life for his children.\n\nIn Chicago, he found a large Ukrainian community. RefugeeOne, Chicago's largest resettlement agency, helped provide everything from housing and groceries to laptops to furniture.\n\nThey quickly found a community at a Ukrainian Baptist church. They're learning English. An elementary school a short distance away. Volianiuk, who worked in civil engineering in Ukraine, is now earning enough with a cable company to support the family.\n\nWhile he's determined to stay, he said views on eventually returning are mixed among those who fled the war.\n\n\"A lot of Ukrainians want to come back home to Ukraine. And a lot of Ukrainians want to stay in the USA or in Europe,\" he said, his wife adding that some in Ukraine resent those who fled the country.\n\nA RefugeeOne spokesman said it often depends on where they are from: Those from Eastern Ukraine, especially from places such as Mariupol and Bakhmut, often feel they have little to which to return.\n\nUkrainian officials are increasingly worried about how a prolonged war will impact its workforce and ability to rebuild, Beirens said. Labor shortages in Europe could mean healthcare workers or college professors find better-paying jobs.\n\nThe war has already decimated millions of jobs in Ukraine and sent tax revenue plummeting, according to a Crisis Group report. The World Bank has projected that Ukraine's shrinking economy could push the majority of the population below the poverty line.\n\nHow many ultimately return is hard to predict based on past examples, she said, in part because of how the Ukrainian crisis differs. During the Syrian war's refugee crisis, it was mainly men who went abroad first to find work and then bring their families. In Ukraine's case, it's mostly women and children.\n\nKateryna Odarchenko, a Ukrainian political consultant, wrote last year that \"At the end of martial law, the husbands of the women who have left will probably rejoin their families, since those families will have already settled into life in other countries,\" potentially fueling a demographic crisis in an aging nation.\n\nLeading up to this month's signs of a new Russian offensive, refugee populations had been relatively steady, said Simon Schlegel, a Kyiv-based Ukraine analyst for the International Crisis Group.\n\nAfter the initial rush a year ago, Ukrainian military gains led to more returns than exits by last summer, he said. That changed in the fall as Russia targeted Ukraine's power grid. By early February, the feared winter surge hadn't materialized, Schlegel said.\n\nMuch of what comes next also depends on the fate of those internally displaced, and those who left for Russia, Schlegel said. While larger cities are more likely to draw people back, some Ukrainian towns in the east, which grew up around a coal or fertilizer plant, could suffer the most from depopulation.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine some of these towns will come to life again, that people will pick up from Germany in come back,\" he said.\n\nIn Ukraine, Mykhailo Tsikhovskyi, 28, who formerly aided refugees and internally displaced residents but is now in a Ukrainian military unit, said his nation first must focus on the fight. \"We need to win first, the rest is a matter of time,\" he said via Whatsapp.\n\nVolianiuk's family hasn't been immune to the war's toll and sacrifice. His brother-in-law, a pilot, was killed in action during the fighting early in the war. And they have ensured that the home they left behind could be used by multiple families among the 6 million displaced within Ukraine.\n\nIf the war ended today, he said, it could take a decade to rebuild from fighting that devastated homes, along with businesses and energy infrastructure.\n\nBut nobody knows the future.\n\nFor now, he's focused on building the best life he can for his children.",

            "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration will expand its use of a public health rule to start expelling to Mexico thousands of Venezuelans who illegally cross the U.S. border and announced a new humanitarian parole program to provide a narrow legal pathway to the United States for up to 24,000 Venezuelans.\n\nThe administration hopes that Venezuelans will apply for the parole plan remotely and fly to the United States rather than making the dangerous trek to the southwest border.\n\nBut the reliance on a Trump-era pandemic rule to deny entry to many others crystallized the Biden administration's balancing act in both helping refugees and tightening border restrictions in the face of Republican attacks on President Biden's immigration policy and record numbers of illegal border crossings. And there is no guarantee that just 27 days before the midterm elections, it will have the desired effect.\n\nUntil now, the majority of Venezuelans who crossed into the United States have not been expelled under the public health authority, known as Title 42. Instead, they were screened and released into the country temporarily to face removal proceedings in immigration court, where they have the option to apply for asylum.\n\nUnder the new plan released by the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday, Venezuelans who enter the United States illegally -- as tens of thousands have been doing for months -- will be expelled to Mexico.\n\nVenezuelans who apply for the humanitarian parole program must have someone in the United States who can show that they are able to financially support the migrant for up to two years. During the application process, the government will assess the sponsor's finances and vet the applicants, who will also have to have certain vaccinations and comply with other public health requirements.\n\nIn addition, any Venezuelan who enters Mexico or Panama illegally or has permanent resident status, dual nationality or refugee status with another country is ineligible for the parole program. Venezuelans who have already been released in the United States to face removal proceedings and apply for asylum are not eligible to apply for the program either.\n\nVenezuelans who are granted the humanitarian parole will be allowed to work legally in the United States and have more stability than those who face removal proceedings.\n\n\"These actions make clear that there is a lawful and orderly way for Venezuelans to enter the United States, and lawful entry is the only way,\" Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the Homeland Security secretary, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nMore on U.S. ImmigrationA New Plan: The Biden administration is considering a humanitarian parole program for some Venezuelans, which officials hope will discourage Venezuelans from making the dangerous trek to the United States to cross the border illegally.Migrant Drop-Offs: The idea of sending migrants to Democratic-leaning areas circulated in conservative circles for years, gaining traction under President Donald J. Trump. Now some Republican governors have put it into practice.Two Million Arrests: For the first time, the number of arrests of undocumented immigrants along the southwestern border exceeded two million in one year, continuing a historic pace of undocumented immigrants coming to the country.Fixing 'a Very Broken System': By making a few changes to the asylum process in the United States, the Biden administration hopes to chip away at a massive backlog of immigration cases.\n\nAnnouncing a new policy less than a month before the midterm elections is a calculated and political decision by the White House, John Thomas, a Republican strategist, said.\n\nHow Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.\n\nLearn more about our process.\n\n\"This is more of an effort to soften people's anger on what's happening on the southern border,\" Mr. Thomas said. \"It also gives the administration a talking point that they are 'doing something.'\"\n\nBut it is not clear that the humanitarian parole and expansion of Title 42 will significantly stem the number of border crossings, as Venezuelans make up only a fraction of the migrants crossing illegally.\n\nAdvocates for immigrant rights have been urging the White House to create a humanitarian parole program for migrants from particularly unstable countries, including Venezuela.\n\nBut they are not supportive of a plan that ties humanitarian parole to expelling thousands of other Venezuelan migrants to the dangerous northern border region of Mexico.\n\n\"It's great to be expanding access to humanitarian parole, but it can't come at the cost of additional harm to asylum seekers,\" said Raha Wala, the deputy director for legislative advocacy for the National Immigration Law Center. \"Title 42 is a cruel, Trump-era, anti-immigrant policy that deserves to be relegated to the dustbin of history, not expanded.\"\n\nEscaping poverty and political instability, more than 6.8 million Venezuelans have fled their country since 2015, according to the United Nations. Most went to other South American countries.\n\nBut in the past year, more and more have been making their way to the United States. In August, Venezuelans made up about 12 percent of those who crossed the southwestern border illegally. While a majority of migrants who do so are expelled back to their country or to Mexico under the public health order, the U.S. government has not been able to repatriate Venezuelans because of minimal diplomatic relations between Washington and Caracas. And -- until now -- Mexico has not been willing to take in Venezuelans from the United States.\n\nThe humanitarian parole program announced on Wednesday appears to be a much more limited version of earlier proposals. One under consideration as recently as last week included Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans, according to officials briefed on the discussions. It was not immediately clear why these nationalities were ultimately left out.\n\nMr. Biden has overseen a record number of border crossings that is part of a global movement with more displaced people than ever before. Since he has been in office, the government has screened and released more than 1 million migrants who crossed the border illegally, giving them temporary permission to stay in the country until they face deportation proceedings in immigration court. The Biden administration has also expelled migrants more than 2 million times under the authority of the public health rule.\n\nThe Biden administration tried to stop using the public health authority earlier this year, but a federal court stopped it from doing so. Now the administration has expanded the authority instead.\n\nBut for vulnerable Democrats in border states, like Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, the ability to campaign on a recent expansion to Title 42 could prove helpful in a tight race, said Carl Fogliani, a Republican political strategist.\n\n\"They would want them to be out there saying how wonderful a development this is,\" Mr. Fogliani said of the White House and Democrats dealing with border issues.",

            "body": "SAN DIEGO, California -- President Joe Biden's top Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials intervened at the last minute to stop a group of Republican lawmakers from viewing the United States-Mexico border in the evening, when border crossers use holes in the unfinished border wall to cross illegally into the U.S.\n\nA delegation of Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, including Reps. Darrell Issa (CA), Tom McClintock (CA), Scott Fitzgerald (WI), Cliff Bentz (OR), and Victoria Spartz (IN), were set for a trip to view the southern border in the evening last week when Biden's DHS officials stepped in to block the visit.\n\n\"The Biden White House canceled our night trip to the border because they didn't want my Republican colleagues to see the flood of migrants, drugs, and trafficked children that pass through the gaps in the border wall that this administration refuses to close,\" Issa told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement.\n\nThe night visit was crucial for the Republican delegation because much of the illegal immigration on the California-Mexico border occurs in the evening. Large holes in the unfinished border wall, captured in exclusive footage by Breitbart News, show ideal paths for border crossers to cross illegally into the U.S., specifically in the evening hours.\n\n\"They're trying to control the narrative,\" a source told Breitbart News.\n\nThe following day, when the Republican delegation toured the border with DHS officials, the agency made a note to clear detention space beforehand.\n\nFor instance, at the DHS's Imperial Beach station, only about 80 to 85 border crossers were in detention when the delegation arrived. The evening before, the station had more than 200 border crossers in detention.\n\n\"They literally cleared out before the congressmen arrived,\" a source told Breitbart News.\n\nOn their tour, the Republican delegation was taken to quiet locations across the San Diego, California, sectors where border crossings were not taking place and where no apprehensions were occurring.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, more than 221,000 border crossers were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border last month. About 80,116 were released into the U.S. interior via parole or other means. Put another way, for every 11 border crossers apprehended, about four are released into American communities.",

            "title": "Nearly 1 million immigrants became U.S. citizens in past year, the 3rd highest tally on record",
            "body": "Washington -- Nearly a million immigrant adults were naturalized as American citizens in fiscal year 2022, the third-highest annual tally recorded in U.S. history, according to a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) report obtained by CBS News.\n\nIn the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, 967,400 adults swore the oath of allegiance at naturalization ceremonies across the country, the USCIS figures show. When taking into account cases of children who derived citizenship from their U.S.-citizen parents and other naturalization cases, a total of 1,023,200 immigrants became U.S. citizens in fiscal year 2022.\n\nThe number of adult immigrants who became U.S. citizens was only greater in 1996 and 2008, when 1,040,991 and 1,046,539 adults were naturalized, respectively, historical government statistics show.\n\nMost naturalized citizens gain citizenship after living in the U.S. as permanent residents for three or five years, depending how they secured legal residency. Those who serve in the military can qualify for a special, fast-track naturalization process. Applicants are also generally required to prove they can read, write and speak English, and understand U.S. history and the system of government.\n\nUnlike permanent residents, immigrants with U.S. citizenship can vote in federal elections, obtain American passports and sponsor family members to come to the U.S. through an expedited process. The top five countries of birth of immigrants who became naturalized U.S. citizens in fiscal year 2022 were Mexico, India, the Philippines, Cuba and the Dominican Republic, according to the USCIS data.\n\nThe 14-year high in naturalizations comes a year after President Biden directed federal agencies to promote naturalizations by eliminating bureaucratic barriers in the citizenship process, speeding up case adjudications and developing a government-wide strategy to encourage eligible immigrants to become citizens.\n\nCiting that directive, USCIS scrapped a Trump administration revision to the naturalization civics questions that critics said made it harder for immigrants to pass the test, which is a requirement for most citizenship applicants. The agency also expanded remote video interviews for naturalization cases.\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, USCIS Director Ur Jaddou said the agency has launched public awareness and information campaigns to make the naturalization process more accessible, and streamlined citizenship cases for U.S. service members. In March 2021, USCIS held the first remote video military naturalization ceremony.\n\n\"It is good for the nation for people to fully become part of this nation, join it in the fullest way that they can,\" Jaddou said this week. \"That has been a priority since the beginning of this administration and we're going to continue the focus on ensuring that people who wish to become Americans, can be.\"\n\nJaddou said the campaign to boost naturalizations among eligible immigrants had to be balanced with an extensive workload at USCIS, including an ongoing effort to reduce a massive backlog of unresolved applications that has crippled the agency's ability to process many petitions promptly.\n\nAs of June 30, USCIS was overseeing more than 8.7 million immigration cases, ranging from green card applications to asylum requests and work permit petitions, according to government statistics. The number of pending citizenship cases stood at 666,473, a 20% drop from the end of fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn its fiscal year 2022 progress report, USCIS noted it processed a record high 275,111 employment-based green cards alongside the State Department, which reviews overseas visa requests. It also implemented a rule to provide relief to immigrants affected by the work permit delays by extending the period of automatic work authorization extensions for those applying for a renewal.\n\nBeyond the case backlogs, USCIS has also recently struggled to shore up its finances. The predominantly fee-funded agency faced financial collapse at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a temporary but sharp drop in applications and the suspension of in-person interviews and other services. While USCIS was able to avert mass furloughs, it implemented a hiring freeze that was only lifted in March 2021.\n\nJaddou asserted that policy and spending decisions by the Trump administration also contributed to the fiscal crisis, saying USCIS was in a \"precarious moment\" at the start of the Biden administration, with less than $200 million in its coffers, some employees departing the agency and contracts with support staff terminated.\n\nThrough millions of dollars allocated by Congress over the past year, Jaddou said USCIS has been able to stabilize the agency's fiscal footing, stage a hiring surge of immigration adjudicators and reduce backlogs for some programs.\n\n\"The good news is we've recovered from that experience. Our financial situation is in a much more solid location,\" Jaddou said.\n\nBut Jaddou said USCIS will need additional funding from Congress to further reduce the agency's multimillion backlog of cases and to administer a growing number of humanitarian programs, some of which do not collect application fees.\n\nOver the past year, USCIS has been tasked with processing various applications from the tens of thousands of Afghans and Ukrainians who have been resettled in the U.S. The agency's other humanitarian missions include screening some asylum-seekers along the U.S.-Mexico border and reviewing requests from immigrants applying for Temporary Protected Status programs, which have grown under Mr. Biden.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, USCIS is expected to issue a rule to raise application fees for certain programs, allow more immigrants to pay extra fees to have their cases reviewed more expeditiously and make additional applications online-based, as opposed to the paper and mail model the agency has relied on for decades, according to Jaddou and Wednesday's report.",

            "body": "SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Forty-six people were found dead after being abandoned in a tractor-trailer on a remote back road in San Antonio in the latest tragedy to claim the lives of migrants smuggled across the border from Mexico to the U.S. Sixteen people were hospitalized, including four children.\n\nA city worker heard a cry for help from the truck shortly before 6 p.m. Monday and discovered the gruesome scene, Police Chief William McManus said. Hours later, body bags lay spread on the ground near the trailer and bodies remained inside as authorities responded to the calamity.\n\nSan Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg said the 46 who died had \"families who were likely trying to find a better life.\"\n\n\"This is nothing short of a horrific human tragedy,\" Nirenberg said.\n\nIt's among the deadliest of the tragedies that have claimed thousands of lives in recent decades as people attempt to cross the U.S. border from Mexico. Ten migrants died in 2017 after being trapped inside a truck parked at a Walmart in San Antonio. In 2003, the bodies of 19 migrants were found in a sweltering truck southeast of San Antonio.\n\nThe home countries of the immigrants and how long they were abandoned on the side of the road were not immediately known.\n\nSouth Texas has long been the busiest area for illegal border crossings. Migrants ride in vehicles through Border Patrol checkpoints to San Antonio, the closest major city, from which point they disperse across the United States.\n\nOfficers arrived to find a body on the ground outside the trailer and a partially opened gate to the trailer. Three people were taken into custody, but it was unclear if they were definitively connected with human trafficking, McManus said.\n\nOf the 16 taken to hospitals with heat-related illnesses, 12 were adults and four were children, said Fire Chief Charles Hood. The patients were hot to the touch and dehydrated, and no water was found in the trailer, he said.\n\n\"They were suffering from heat stroke and exhaustion,\" Hood said. \"It was a refrigerated tractor-trailer, but there was no visible working AC unit on that rig.\"\n\nThose in the trailer were part of a presumed migrant smuggling attempt into the United States, and the investigation was being led by U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, McManus said.\n\nBig rigs emerged as a popular smuggling method in the early 1990s amid a surge in U.S. border enforcement in San Diego and El Paso, Texas, which were then the busiest corridors for illegal crossings.\n\nBefore that, people paid small fees to mom-and-pop operators to get them across a largely unguarded border. As crossing became exponentially more difficult after the 2001 terror attacks in the U.S., migrants were led through more perilous terrain and paid thousands of dollars more.\n\nHeat poses a serious danger, particularly when temperatures can rise severely inside vehicles. Weather in the San Antonio area was mostly cloudy Monday, but temperatures approached 100 degrees.\n\nSome advocates drew a link to the Biden administration's border policies. Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council, wrote that he had been dreading such a tragedy for months.\n\n\"With the border shut as tightly as it is today for migrants from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, people have been pushed into more and more dangerous routes. Truck smuggling is a way up,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nStephen Miller, a chief architect of former President Donald Trump's immigration policies, said, \"Human smugglers and traffickers are wicked and evil\" and that the administration's approach to border security rewards their actions.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican running for reelection, was blunt in a tweet about the Democratic president: \"These deaths are on Biden. They are a result of his deadly open border policies.\"\n\nMigrants -- largely from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- have been expelled more than 2 million times under a pandemic-era rule in effect since March 2020 that denies them a chance to seek asylum but encourages repeat attempts because there are no legal consequences for getting caught. People from other countries, notably Cuba, Nicaragua and Colombia, are subject to Title 42 authority less frequently due to higher costs of sending them home, strained diplomatic relations and other considerations.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 557 deaths on the southwest border in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, more than double the 247 deaths reported in the previous year and the highest since it began keeping track in 1998. Most are related to heat exposure.\n\nCBP has not published a death tally for this year but said that the Border Patrol performed 14,278 \"search-and-rescue missions\" in a seven-month period through May, exceeding the 12,833 missions performed during the previous 12-month period and up from 5,071 the year before.\n\n___\n\nSpagat reported from San Diego.

            "body": "Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick weighs in as the Biden administration considers ending Title 42, which allows for the rapid expulsion of migrants.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., on Friday tore into the Biden administration's move to lift the Title 42 border policy at the end of May, calling it a \"frightening decision\" and warning that the extraordinary numbers will \"only get worse\" in the months ahead.\n\n\"Today's announcement by the [Centers for Disease Control] and the Biden administration is a frightening decision,\" Manchin said in a statement.\n\nBIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO LIFT TITLE 42 AT END OF MAY, DESPITE FEARS OF LOOMING MIGRANT WAVE\n\nThe CDC announced that it will be lifting the Title 42 public health policy, that has been used by both the Trump and Biden administrations to quickly expel migrants at the southern border since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, on May 23.\n\n\"After considering current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight COVID-19 (such as highly effective vaccines and therapeutics), the CDC Director has determined that an Order suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary,\" the Centers for Disease Control said in a statement earlier on Friday.\n\nWhile Title 42 is a public health order, not an immigration policy, it has become one of the central border policies in place as the U.S. faces a continuing crisis of numbers at the border. In February, approximately 55% of migrants were returned due to the order, rather than being released into the U.S.\n\nLeft-wing activists and top Democrats have called for such a move for months.\n\nDEM SENATORS SOUND ALARM OVER REPORTS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WILL END TITLE 42 BORDER POLICY\n\nBut along with Republicans and border officials, a number of moderate Democrats have expressed concern that such a move will lead to a surge in the already massive numbers being encountered at the border.\n\nManchin, who this week called for the administration to make Title 42 permanent, said on Friday that Title 42 has been \"essential\" in combating COVID-19 and controlling the migrant flows.\n\n\"We are already facing an unprecedented increase in migrants this year, and that will only get worse if the Administration ends the Title 42 policy,\" he said. We are nowhere near prepared to deal with that influx.\"\n\n\"Until we have comprehensive, bipartisan immigration reform that commits to securing our borders and providing a pathway to citizenship for qualified immigrants, Title 42 must stay in place,\" he said.\n\nHe was not the only Democrat to object to the move. Arizona Sens. Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema had voiced their concerns to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas this week about a potential ending of the order. Meanwhile, Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., expressed her fears about a coming migrant wave.\n\n\"Ending Title 42 prematurely will likely lead to a migrant surge that the administration does not appear to be ready for,\" she said.\n\nThe administration, meanwhile, has sought to downplay those concerns. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Friday claimed that DHS has \"put in place a comprehensive, whole-of-government strategy to manage any potential increase in the number of migrants encountered at our border.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We are increasing our capacity to process new arrivals, evaluate asylum requests, and quickly remove those who do not qualify for protection,\" he said in a statement. \"We will increase personnel and resources as needed and have already redeployed more than 600 law enforcement officers to the border. We are referring smugglers and certain border crossers for criminal prosecution. Over the next two months, we are putting in place additional, appropriate COVID-19 protocols, including ramping up our vaccination program.\"",

This year's races could tip the balance of power in Congress to Republicans, hobbling President Biden's agenda for the second half of his term. They will also test former President Donald J. Trump's role as a G.O.P. kingmaker. Here's what to know:\n\nWhat are the midterm elections? Midterms take place two years after a presidential election, at the midpoint of a presidential term -- hence the name. This year, a lot of seats are up for grabs, including all 435 House seats, 35 of the 100 Senate seats and 36 of 50 governorships.\n\nWhat do the midterms mean for Biden? With slim majorities in Congress, Democrats have struggled to pass Mr. Biden's agenda. Republican control of the House or Senate would make the president's legislative goals a near-impossibility.\n\nWhat are the races to watch? Only a handful of seats will determine if Democrats maintain control of the House over Republicans, and a single state could shift power in the 50-50 Senate. Here are 10 races to watch in the House and Senate, as well as several key governor's contests.\n\nWhen are the key races taking place? The primary gauntlet is already underway. Closely watched races in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia will be held in May, with more taking place through the summer. Primaries run until September before the general election on Nov. 8.\n\nGo deeper. What is redistricting and how does it affect the midterm elections? How does polling work? How do you register to vote? We've got more answers to your pressing midterm questions here.\n\nA memo on July 9 pointed to immigration and crime as two major weaknesses for Mr. Biden.\n\n\"President Biden continues to hold weaker, negative ratings on two hot-button issues that have been recently bubbling up,\" Mr. Anzalone said.\n\nThree days later, the president held a meeting on policing with Eric Adams, who would win the New York City mayoral election months later by making public safety a focus of his campaign.

            "title": "In Ohio Senate Fight, G.O.P. Shows Strains of Its Identity Crisis",
            "body": "CLEVELAND -- The homestretch of Ohio's contentious Republican Senate primary has revealed a party united in its conviction that American values, indeed the nation's way of life, are under attack, but divided on whether to embrace a strict isolationism to address its mounting misgivings about global interconnectedness and American leadership abroad.\n\nThat divide has played out in policy differences -- some subtle, others glaring -- in the candidates' approach to the economy, immigration and foreign policy. The strains reflect the broader splits in a party undergoing something of an identity crisis, with ideological conservatives, the old Republican establishment of big business, and the Trump-inspired newer rank and file all pulling in different directions.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans have been searching for ways to relate to former President Donald J. Trump himself: a few by taking tentative steps away from him, others by falling in line with him wholeheartedly.\n\nAll of the candidates competing in the primary on Tuesday appear united in their fierce opposition to the Biden administration, as they have sought to paint a nation grappling with rising food and energy prices, a \"radical\" Democratic Party overreaching on issues of race and gender, and what they describe as apocalyptic conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nBut the world beyond Mexico may be the brightest dividing line in the Republican Party, with conservatives split on what to do about Russian aggression, how far to distance the United States from its traditional alliances, and above all what to do about China, at once the nation's biggest competitor and one of its largest economic partners.\n\nOver the past weeks, Josh Mandel, Ohio's former treasurer and the onetime front-runner in the Senate primary, attacked a rival, Mike Gibbons, for making money off investments in China. J.D. Vance, the author and venture capital executive, attacked Mr. Mandel for accepting the help of the Club for Growth, the business-backed political group which he said supported business relations with China. And the sole woman in the race, Jane Timken, shares her last name with a company that is synonymous with Ohio manufacturing might -- and that includes vast operations out of Shanghai.\n\nWhoever wins Tuesday will have to deal with those divisions in the coming general election campaign, especially since the presumed Democratic candidate, Representative Tim Ryan, has no qualms about blasting China while backing U.S. involvement elsewhere.\n\n\"Voters don't always have long memories here, especially after a primary campaign, but certainly the anti-China feelings are going to resonate for a long time,\" said Paul Beck, a professor emeritus of political science at Ohio State University and a longtime Ohio politics watcher. \"They are hard-wired.\"\n\nDivisions over the border are not so stark. Anger at Mexican criminal organizations that are distributing fentanyl to the north has become particularly salient in a state that has been ground zero for the national opioid crisis and experienced some of the country's highest overdose rates over the past three years.\n\nMr. Vance, who won Mr. Trump's coveted endorsement, has even suggested, with a straight face but no evidence, that President Biden was intentionally allowing fentanyl into the country because of its potential to kill Republican voters, bringing the issue back to his mother, who as a nurse became addicted to pain medication. Fentanyl deaths did rise sharply in 2021, but they rose sharply in 2020 as well.\n\n\"My family was very affected and is still very affected by the fentanyl that comes across the U.S. southern border into Ohio and into all parts of our country,\" he told an audience in Newark, Ohio, on Saturday. \"I believe that if the poison coming across the Mexican border today had been coming across 10 years ago, I would have lost my mother.\"\n\nMuch of the debate and bluster on the border has been lacking in substance and filled with conjecture, with candidates proposing few policy solutions, conflating immigration and crime and resorting to language that dehumanizes unauthorized immigrants.\n\nBut beneath the hard-right rhetoric, subtle differences can be seen between the pro-business, establishment Republicans of the past and the ascendant hard right.\n\nIn stump speeches and a much-criticized campaign ad, Mr. Vance has falsely declared that people are entering the country to vote for Democrats. He has said he is in favor of an immigration process that creates legal paths to entering the country based on merit, rather than on familial ties, long a key feature of the nation's immigration system. And he opposes H-1B visas that allow employers to temporarily hire immigrant workers in various industries.\n\nAt the other end of the issue is Matt Dolan, an Ohio state senator who has sought to put some distance between himself and the former president. Mr. Dolan, too, talks tough on immigration and the need to stop the flow of fentanyl. But he is just as concerned about economic development, supporting tax cuts, training for workers and reduced regulations for small businesses. And he favors the immigrant work visas, saying businesses rely on them.\n\n\"We have to secure the border first -- that has to be number one,\" Mr. Dolan said in an interview last week. \"And then improve our legal immigration.\"\n\nPerhaps the most glaring examples in Ohio of the forces warring within the Republican Party have unfolded over competition with China, the war in Ukraine and American leadership abroad. Again setting himself apart, Mr. Vance has argued against deepening American involvement on Ukraine's behalf -- despite what many see as the gravest threat to world order in decades.\n\nMr. Vance opposed the establishment of a European-led no-fly zone over Ukraine, and has drawn criticism for a statement he made in February in which he said he did not \"really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\" He has since sought to assure audiences he feels Ukrainians' pain, but has doubled down on his stance against U.S. intervention.\n\n\"At the end of the day, however tragic we find these images of what is going on in Ukraine, this is not our fight,\" Mr. Vance said in a debate last month.\n\nThe distinctions could also be seen in the surrogates the Ohio candidates brought in to campaign with them in the final stretch.\n\nMr. Mandel chose as his wingman for the final weekend Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who in 2016 was Mr. Trump's biggest threat and remains fiercely conservative in ways the former president never was. Mr. Cruz has consistently attacked Mr. Biden as weak on foreign policy, going so far as to blame him for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And Mr. Cruz, like Republican congressional leaders, has shied away from some of Mr. Trump's broader attacks on corporate America -- especially the pharmaceutical industry -- which often echoed Democratic talking points.\n\nMr. Vance, by contrast, stumped over the weekend with two of the most polarizing figures of the far right: Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida. Ms. Greene railed against the \"forever wars\" started under George W. Bush and talked up what she called \"the civil war in the G.O.P.,\" while Mr. Gaetz blasted the leaders of his own party and said he and Ms. Greene needed backup in Washington -- backup that Mr. Vance would provide.\n\nMr. Gibbons, for his part, campaigned with Senator Rand Paul, the Kentuckian who espouses small government, low taxes and the avoidance of foreign entanglements at all cost. And Mr. Gibbons embraced a fringe movement to hold a constitutional convention aimed at curbing federal power, and mocked the Department of Homeland Security's new effort to counter disinformation as an Orwellian Ministry of Truth.\n\nOne area in which there is broad agreement among the party's Senate candidates is on the conservative values many Ohio Republicans say they hold dear, from old standbys like support for gun rights and opposition to abortion, to current causes like preventing transgender women from playing women's sports and giving parents greater control over how race and gender are taught in schools.\n\nOn those issues, consensus among the candidates was so fully realized that voters at events in Cleveland seemed widely split over whom to support, and many were still undecided.\n\nIn Port Clinton, where Ms. Timken, Mr. Gibbons and Mr. Dolan all worked the crowd at a Knights of Columbus chicken barbecue lunch, Lisa Slobodzian said she was still sifting through her direct mail and studying the candidates' positions.\n\n\"I want power back to the people,\" said Ms. Slobodzian, 57, a retired national parks ranger and law enforcement specialist, digging into her plate. \"They should decide what their kids are taught in schools, and not some government agency.\"",

            "body": "UNITED STATES - As the Biden administration continues to allow immigrants to illegally cross the southern border, the data is now showing that in September alone, there were 20 suspected terrorists arrested by Border Patrol agents.\n\nFox News reported that the number of migrant encounters at the southern border climbed to a record of more than 227,000 during the month of September and more than 2.3 million for fiscal year 2022.\n\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uploaded the border numbers on Friday, October 21st. September had the highest number of encounters in Department of Homeland Security (DHS) history.\n\nCBP's numbers also show that there were 20 known or suspected terrorists arrested at the southern border in the month of September, bringing the total terror watchlist arrests at the border for fiscal year 2022 to 98.\n\nThe number of terror watchlist arrests at the border for the last five years combined was only 26. September's border encounters were significantly higher compared to the same month in recent years.\n\nFor example, in September 2021, there were 192,001 migrant encounters; in September 2020 there were 57,674 migrant encounters; and in September 2019 there were 52,546 migrant encounters. In a press release, CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus said:\n\n\"While failing regimes in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua continued to drive a new wave of migration across the western Hemisphere, the number of Venezuelans arriving at the southern border decreased sharply nearly every day since we launched additional joint actions with Mexico to reduce irregular migration and create a more fair, orderly and safe process for people fleeing the humanitarian and economic crisis in their country.\"\n\nHe added:\n\n\"Over the past week, the number of Venezuelans attempting to enter the country fell more than 80 percent compared to the week prior to the launch of the joint enforcement actions.\n\nWhile this early data is not reflected in the latest report, it confirms what we've said all along: when there is a lawful and orderly way to enter the country, individuals will be less likely to put their lives in the hands of smugglers and try to cross the border unlawfully.\"\n\nThe September data revealed that fiscal year 2022 ended with 2,378,944 migrant encounters at the southern border, the highest ever recorded in a fiscal year.\n\nCBP sources stated that this number, however, does not include 599,000 known \"gotaways\" whom evaded capture during fiscal year 2022. Magnus said:\n\n\"CBP and DHS will continue to work with our partners in the region to address the root causes of migration, expand legal pathways, facilitate removals, and take thousands of smugglers off the streets.\n\nNo matter what smugglers say, those who do not have a legal basis to remain in the country will be removed and people should not make the dangerous journey.\"\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said that the Border Patrol was \"overrun\" and the \"consequences of these lax enforcement actions should concern every single American.\"\n\nSen. Rob Portman (R-OH), the top Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said in a statement on Monday, October 24th:\n\n\"Our adversaries know they can enter our country through our failed border.\"\n\nAs reported by the Examiner, the spike in the number of terrorist-related arrests coincides with a dramatic demographic change in the nationalities of immigrants trying to enter the U.S. through the southern border, with an uptick in citizens from Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua.\n\nDo you want to join our private family of first responders and supporters?

In response, Ducey's administration stated that border states \"cannot rely on the federal government to ensure its security.\"\n\nAllen Clark, director of Arizona's Department of Emergency and Military Affairs, wrote a letter to the Department of Interior's Bureau of Reclamation, and said:\n\n\"The myriad of federal agencies that claim jurisdiction on the southern border but do nothing to prevent the public nuisance caused by illegal immigration and criminal activity that exploits the open border is quite frustrating to those that live, work and recreate on the border and in our state.\"\n\nThe bureau had sent its own letter to Ducey's office, arguing that the move in August to fill nearly 4,000 feet of gaps in the border wall with shipping containers topped with razor wire is \"illegal.\"\n\nIn August, the governor announced the filling of the gaps and the construction consisted of 60 double-stacking shipping containers, welded shut and topped with four feet of razor wire. The end product is 22 feet talk and weighs nearly 9,000 pounds. At the time Ducey said in a statement:\n\n\"Arizona has had enough. We can't wait any longer.\"\n\nIn its letter, the bureau claims that Arizona placed containers on lands within the vicinity of the Morelos Dam and also on land that is part of the Cocopath Indian Tribe's West Reservation.\n\nIt also stated that the placement of the containers \"interferes\" with a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) project to fill the gaps. It then called on the state to stop any further construction and to remove the containers. The letter stated, in part:\n\n\"The unauthorized placement of those containers constitutes a violation of federal law and is a trespass against the United States. That trespass is harming federal lands and resources and impeding Reclamation's ability to perform its mission.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the bureau said that the agency's priority is to ensure the integrity of the water delivery infrastructure and the safety of its workforce in order to maintain operational readiness.\n\nThe letter comes more than two month's after Ducey's office sealed the gaps and was issued just as CBP announced its own plan to close the gaps near the Morelos Dam.\n\nAccording to the CBO notice, the gaps will be filled with a \"combination of temporary mesh fencing and mechanized bollard vehicle gates that allow for access to the riverside of the barrier,\" and construction of the temporary replacement would not begin until early 2023.\n\nClark said that Arizona disagrees with the federal government's claim that Arizona has trespassed against the U.S., arguing that the regulation in question provides an exemption for federal and state employees when carrying out official duties. He wrote:\n\n\"Moreover, 43 C.F.R. Part 429.4(c)(8) provides that 'activities authorized under other Federal statutes or regulations' are not subject to regulation. Since, the U.S. Constitution provides for the protection of the states (Article IV, section 4) and specifically reserves the right of states to defend themselves (Article 1, section 10), the regulation you cite does not prohibit Arizona's actions.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Arizona and the Biden administration come as states are increasingly taking matters related to illegal immigration and border security into their own hands.\n\nDo you want to join our private family of first responders and supporters?

It is time we fix our broken immigration system-but any reform efforts MUST begin with securing our borders...Secretary Mayorkas said the border is 'secure,' to which I say this is not only intellectually dishonest but also an outright lie.\"\n\nRep. Flores also spoke specifically about the number of bodies that were discovered in the Rio Grand Valley alone:\n\n\"Our families and communities in the RGV are paying for the cost of this administration's self-inflicted humanitarian and security crisis. I've heard firsthand horror stories on many occasions, and it breaks my heart that Washington, DC treats this like a political issue and not what it really is-life and death. We need leadership and we need it now.\"\n\nWhile the people who lose their lives in attempts to illegally enter the country are tragic, think for a moment how many more deaths may come as a result of the border being open.\n\nBeyond the drug dealers and human trafficking that occurs at the border, a reasonable person must also ask how many terrorists and weapons have been snuck into the country.\n\nIf President Biden's Administration cannot stop those that are simply wanting to move into the country, how can the administration possibly stop terrorists and weapons from entering?",

            "body": "The U.S. construction industry can build more houses by importing a huge number of foreign workers via the H-2A farm worker program, says an economist who is working for an investor group.\n\n\"How do we build more [housing] ASAP?\" asked Adam Ozimek, an economist who works for an investor-backed advocacy group.\n\nThe answer, he said, is a \"Dramatic one-time expansion of H2A visas for construction workers.\"\n\nThe federal government already allows farm companies to import their own seasonal labor via the H-2A visa program, which is somewhat similar to the H-1B program used by the Fortune 500. In 2021, farm companies imported roughly 300,000 H-2A workers -- effectively replacing many Americans who would have worked those jobs in exchange for decent wages.\n\nOzimek works for the Economic Innovation Group. The investor-backed group wants to gain by importing migrants into depopulated, once-wealthy areas, such as upstate New York. For example, the inflow of new migrants would help investors by boosting land prices, but would also hurt younger Americans by making housing more expensive.\n\nOzimek's cheap-labor fix for a worker shortage is \"like saying you're gonna hit yourself on the head with a hammer until it stops hurting,\" responded Steve Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\n\"If you're bringing in foreign labor and keeping wages down, then you're constantly going to have a labor shortage,\" he added.\n\nBut migration is a double benefit for construction companies, he said, adding: \"If you can [use migration to] increase demand for housing and at the same time, lower the price of construction labor, that's a win-win.\"\n\nOzimek did not explain how the H-2A farm workers could legally be imported to build houses. He declined to answer questions from Breitbart News.\n\nThe federal policy of importing workers for favored business sectors \"is one way the government puts its finger on the scale for business owners, and it's not at all clear that that's the best option for society,\" he added.\n\nFor example, a shortage of American construction workers may spur companies to hire and train sidelined Americans, and also to develop new and more productive ways of building houses. The resulting productivity gains would raise average wages and allow ordinary Americans to buy more houses, Camarota said.\n\nBut any government supply of cheap outside labor encourages other companies to avoid making expensive investments in productivity, he said. In turn, that avoidance can deter other companies from taking the risk of developing the techniques, he said.\n\nThe same dilemma exists in the farm sector where many farm companies are reluctant to invest in robot technology until they see other companies succeed in using the robots. But few farm companies want to be the first to take that robot risk -- especially if their business rivals are still using government-supplied cheap, low-risk, and disposable H-2A workers. Meanwhile, the farm companies' widespread use of low-status, low-wage illegal workers and visa workers deter Americans from seeking jobs in the sector.\n\nCurrently, President Joe Biden's border agencies are allowing roughly 200,000 economic migrants a month into the U.S. housing and labor markets. Simultaneously, per-person productivity in U.S. workplaces has dropped at a record pace.\n\nBut the government's supply of labor also has had a huge civic impact.\n\nSince the 1980s, a huge number of middle-class American construction workers have lost wages and careers after being sidelined by a massive wave of low-wage, low-tech migrants. In 2018, Blaine Taylor, a construction worker in California described the dramatic wage cuts caused by illegal migration into California:\n\nIf I hired a framer to do a small addition [in 1988], his wage would have been $45 an hour. That was the minimum for a framing contractor, a good carpenter ... Now, the average wage in Los Angeles for construction workers is less than $11 an hour. They can't go lower than the minimum wage. And much of that, if they're not being paid by the hour at less than $11 an hour, they're being paid per piece.\n\nThe wages not paid to the construction workers were split between profit-maximizing employers and cost-conscious consumers. The wholesale replacement of Americans also discouraged younger generations of blue-collar Americans from learning the skills needed for construction.\n\nBy allowing a steady inflow of foreign workers, \"we're making jobs that could be solidly middle class into lower-middle-class jobs,\" Camarota said, adding:\n\nMost working-class people worry about their child who doesn't have a college degree ever being able to earn enough money to have a house. By most studies, over the last 30 or 40 years, people have seen either a stagnation or a decline in wages. There are exceptions at the very top, but overall -- certainly for the non-college educated -- we know for a fact they're not doing well, and that's a concern and now you've got the government putting his finger on the scale.\n\n\"Capital is getting a bigger share of the economic pie..... That's one reason why the stock market has risen for the last 30 years, but not wages,\" he said.",

            "body": "Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn and various other senators said nothing in defense of young American men and women when university lobbies used a June 14 hearing to request more foreign students that will take white-collar jobs sought by young Americans.\n\n\"There are over a million fewer U.S. domestic students enrolled in college than there were just three years ago ... [and] compared to five years ago, international student enrollment has declined by 21 percent,\" Bernard Burrola, a vice president at the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities, told a Senate hearing on June 14.\n\nMillions of foreign students have enrolled in U.S. universities because a White House policy set by President George W. Bush allows them to get \"Optional Practical Training\" work permits for the rising jobs needed by American graduates.\n\nThe foreign students are a bonanza for the universities and their local economies, Burrola told Cornyn and Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA), the chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on immigration and border safety:\n\nThey generate huge economic activity in our communities. International students contributed this past year over $30 billion through paying tuition rent and living expenses ... Imagine where we could be if we made attracting and retaining global talent a centerpiece of our U.S. economic and foreign policy strategy.\n\nCornyn has a long history of quietly backing legalized labor migration into the jobs needed by white-collar and blue-collar Americans, even as he also publicly votes against obvious amnesties for illegal migrants.\n\n\"I've long been a supporter of employment-based immigration,\" Cornyn told a June 14 hearing:\n\nIt doesn't matter where you're from or where you live, if you have skills that can contribute to our economy and our country, our employment-based immigration program provides a path for you to come to the United States legally.\n\nCornyn continued:\n\nAnd our immigration system is struggling to keep pace. Per-country caps have artificially limited access to employment-based visas for prospective immigrants from countries like India, preventing workers who want to contribute to our economy for being able to do. And our existing guest [worker] programs need to be updated to meet today's challenges ...\n\nToday's hearing is focused on one potential source of highly trained workers who could contribute to our economy: Individuals who come to study at our universities and other educational institutions on F, J and a M visa ... Every year, more than 200,000 new highly skilled students temporarily join our workforce through the Optional Practical Training program, outstripping the number of permanent [U.S.] positions available to them when they finish this program. I look forward to hearing about the proposals that would allow us to harness these [foreign] students' skills in the longer term.\n\n\"He's certainly being responsive to the business interests,\" said Steven Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies. \"But it's not clear if he will act on it because it's the kind of thing that's popular with the Chamber of Commerce, but not with actual voters,\" he told Breitbart News.\n\n\"He says he's against amnesty, while at the same time he's working with Indian outsourcing companies to increase the number of [white collar] employment visa holders coming to the country,\" said Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers. Senators \"know that this practice leads to the displacement of American white-collar professionals, yet they will do nothing to stop it -- [yet Cornyn] appears to be a hawk on immigration because he also takes stands against amnesty.\"\n\nThe visa worker programs are unpopular among the swing-voting white-collar Americans who work in the professional sector, said a 2014 study by academics at Stanford University: \"Using a targeted, web-based survey of respondents in high-technology counties, that research finds that native workers employed in the high-tech sector are 7-10 percentage points more opposed to extending visas to high-tech workers from abroad compared with natives in other sectors.\"\n\nCornyn's office declined to discuss the senator's view of migration, jobs, and wages with Breitbart News.\n\nCornyn has long protected the little-publicized corporate hiring of migrants for white-collar jobs, even as he also denounces amnesties.\n\nFor example, in 2011, Cornyn intervened with officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to reverse a policy decision that protected many American graduates from being replaced by wage-cutting H-1B workers. Computerworld.com reported in 2011:\n\nThe [DHS] \"should not create a new policy that essentially denies the entire IT consulting and staffing industry access to H-1B workers,\" said Cornyn. \"Without H-1B workers, many companies who are part of the multibillion-dollar IT industry will either move offshore or simply go out of business -- both of which will have a significant impact on the U.S. workforce,\" wrote Cornyn.\n\nSince that 2011 intervention, the Fortune 500's many subcontractors have used foreign visa workers to displace huge numbers of American graduates from starter jobs in the tech sector.\n\nThe white-collar visa worker labor force consists of roughly 1.5 million workers, mostly Indian and Chinese graduates, carrying H-1B, H4EAD, L-1, L-2, J-1, OPT, TN, or other work permits. It also includes a large and growing population of white-collar illegal aliens who overstay their work visas, or who illegally work while using B-1/B-2 tourist visas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's Department of Homeland Security does little to curb fraud or protect American graduates from this inflow. In fact, it has recently opened up new pipelines through the J-1 program and allows temporary workers to extend their work permits.\n\nThis massive green card workforce is preferred by U.S. CEOs because the CEOs control the foreign workers' chance to win the big prize of green cards. This CEO power ensures the visa workers are cheaper, compliant with VPs' demands, and less likely to quit.\n\nBut the replacement of free-speaking American professionals with subordinate indentured foreign labor helps Fortune 500 executives to tighten control over their companies, minimize job-switching by skilled professionals, and to sacrifice research, security, and information privacy in favor of boosting short-term stock prices. Those workplace changes curb industry-wide innovation and encourage corporate disasters, such as the disasters at Intel, Boeing, and Theranos.\n\nThe inflow of visa workers is also reducing the wages and wealth of the U.S. professional class. \"Most college graduates have actually seen their real incomes stagnate or even decline\" since 2000, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote on April 29.\n\nMany Republican legislators are speaking against the replacement of American professionals by indentured foreign workers. The opponents include Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Sen. Todd Young (R-IN), and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA).\n\nBut many Democrats echo Cornyn's support for greater corporate use of visa workers instead of Americans -- especially if they can swap visa workers in exchange for an amnesty.\n\n\"The most valuable natural resource any country has the genius of its people,\" said Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), before demanding more foreign workers for the good jobs sought by college graduates in his home state:\n\nWe're losing out in this competition in terms of students coming to this country in recent years, and this is incredible wealth that helps us to stay competitive. International student enrollment in the U.S. decreased by 7 percent. between 2017 to 2019. Enrollment went up by 23 percent in our amongst our competitors in the UK, 43 percent amongst our competitors in Australia, 52 percent amongst our competitors in Canada, and they are benefiting from that driving economy ... This is such a self inflicted wound.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) also supported the outsourcing industry:\n\n[The U.S.] needlessly turns away potential students who want the chance to give back by contributing to the economy in the place where they've earned their degree. It also shuts out refugees who have no home to return to ... Potential international students are increasingly questioning whether it is worth it to come and study in the United States.\n\n\"I want ... to associate myself with the comments of Senator Cornyn,\" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) said at the June hearing. \"I think it's time to get something done.\"\n\nBurrola, the university advocate, echoed Cornyn, Padilla, Tillis, and Booker:\n\nOur universities are incredibly and heavily dependent on international students for the advanced STEM fields in particular. Over half of our graduate-degree earners in areas like engineering, advanced sciences, mathematics, applied math, quantum computing, AI, are international students that are filling those seats. We do not produce at the moment the domestic talent to fill those seats ... we're not producing that talent here in the U.S.\n\nMany university employees want more visa workers and foreign students, in part, because the migrants boost the income and status of university employees.\n\nFor example, Stanford economist Ran Abramitzky lamented Trump's 2020 curb on the inflow of students who work as cheap labor in U.S. colleges:\n\nIt will reduce the ability of American universities to attract bright people from all over the world, reduce the competitiveness of American universities and we will miss out on all the great new ideas these students generate ... Our graduate students also serve as teachers and teaching assistants for our undergraduate courses, so stripping their visas will sacrifice our undergraduate program by making less teachers available.\n\nThe loss of foreign students will also minimize his productivity and political reach, complained Abramitzky, who is also an immigrant:\n\nMy own international graduate student advisees went on to find impressive jobs in academia, business, and government. Some became professors at universities like Harvard, Northwestern, U Penn, UCLA and UC Davis, others became economists at institutions like the World Bank. Some joined industry, some started their own companies and some became academics and leaders in their home countries.\n\nAbramatizky is a co-author of a new book that touts migration. His co-author is Leah Boustan at Princeton and they argue in their new book, Streets of Gold: America's Untold Story of Immigrant Success, that the children of migrants do better than the children of Americans.\n\nThe migrants outpace Americans because the migrants give up their home community to work in high-growth cities, while Americans are reluctant to give up their valuable home communities and so pay higher rents in the cities. The authors' book recognizes that migrants reduce the pressure on U.S. employers to raise wages or invest in labor-saving technologies. The book is muted about most migrants' damaging impact on productivity and on investors' declining willingness to invest in the interior states.\n\nAfter watching the June 14 hearing, \"it is extremely troubling that no elected official voices any serious concern about the impact of bringing in more foreign workers on Americans,\" said Camarota.\n\n\"Politicians and pundits have bemoaned the long-term stagnation -- or even decline in real wages -- as well as bring people back into the labor force,\" he said, adding, \"We now have a chance to raise wages and draw more people back into jobs, but politicians want to short circuit that with ever more immigration.\"",

            "body": "WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - The Biden administration will make it easier for Indians to live and work in the United States, using this week's state visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help some skilled workers enter or remain in the country, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe State Department could announce as soon as Thursday that a small number of Indians and other foreign workers on H-1B visas will be able to renew those visas in the U.S., without having to travel abroad, one of the sources said, part of a pilot program that could be expanded in coming years.\n\nIndian citizens are by far the most active users of the U.S. H-1B program and made up 73% of the nearly 442,000 H-1B workers in fiscal year 2022.\n\n\"We all recognize that mobility of our people is a huge asset to us,\" said another U.S. official. \"And so our goal is to approach that in a sort of multifaceted way. The State Department already has been working very hard to find creative ways to make changes to things.\"\n\nA State Department spokesperson declined to comment on questions about which visa types would qualify or the timing of the pilot launch. Plans for a pilot program were first reported by Bloomberg Law in February.\n\n\"The pilot would begin with a small number of cases with the intention to scale the initiative over the following one to two years,\" the spokesperson said, while declining to define small.\n\nThe steps could change and are not finalized until they are announced. The White House declined to comment.\n\nEach year, the U.S. government makes 65,000 H-1B visas available to companies seeking skilled foreign workers, along with an additional 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees. The visas last for three years and can be renewed for another three years.\n\nThe companies using the most H-1B workers in recent years include the Indian-based Infosys (INFY.NS) and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.NS) as well as Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Meta (META.O) in the U.S., according to U.S. government data.\n\nThe ability for some of the temporary foreign workers to renew visas in the U.S. would free up resources for visa interviews in consulates abroad, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe pilot program would also include some workers with L-1 visas, which are available to people transferring within a company to a position in the U.S., one of the sources said.\n\nA separate initiative to clear a backlog of visa applications at U.S. embassies in India is finally showing signs of progress, according to another one of those sources, and is expected to be figure into the discussions between the two countries' delegations in Washington this week.\n\nIndia has long had concerns with the difficulty its citizens face in receiving visas to live in the United States, including technology industry workers. More than 10 million jobs stood open in the United States at the end of April, according to the Labor Department.\n\nSome H-1B visa holders in the U.S. have been among the thousands of tech workers laid off this year, sending them scrambling to find new employers within a 60-day \"grace period\" or return to their home country.\n\nThe Biden administration has spent months working to improve visa access for Indians, trying to get around the lack of political will in Congress to comprehensively reform U.S. immigration policy. President Joe Biden wants to knit together the world's two largest democracies, partly in a bid to better compete with China.\n\nU.S. visa services are still attempting to clear a backlog after Washington halted almost all visa processing worldwide in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The visa backlog has led to some families being separated for extended periods of time, with some taking to social media to lament their situation.",

            "body": "BANCROFT (Idaho Statesman) -- In U.S. foreign labor programs, workers place their well-being in the hands of U.S. employers, who are required by law to pay required wages and provide safe living conditions.\n\nAn Idaho potato farm failed to do that, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nA Department of Labor investigation found Jorgensen Management Inc., a potato farm in southeast Idaho, failed to pay its workers a total of $159,256 in wages and did not reimburse them for transportation costs. Jorgensen Management also threatened to end its workers' contracts and \"send workers back to Mexico\" if they did not accept the lower wages, the investigation found.\n\nThe Jorgensen Management workers in Bancroft, Idaho, were part of the H-2A visa program, a seasonal program that allows agricultural employers to bring in foreign workers to temporarily fill jobs when they can't find enough domestic workers. The employers are required by the Department of Labor to pay a set wage and provide workers with transportation and housing.\n\nIn addition to failing to pay workers their legal wage, the Department of Labor also found Jorgensen's housing and safety standards for its employees did not meet \"mandatory housing safety and health standards.\"\n\n\"By threatening and shortchanging some of the lowest paid workers in our nation, Jorgensen Management showed a willful disregard for the law,\" said Carrie Aguilar, the Department of Labor wage and hour district director in Portland. \"They created a toxic workplace and victimized these vulnerable workers. The outcome of this investigation sends a strong message to other employers that the Wage and Hour Division will not tolerate abuses of the H-2A program and will protect the rights of all people working in the U.S.\"\n\nThe Wage and Hour District investigation led the Department of Labor to recover $159,256 in unpaid wages and assess $25,430 in civil money penalties.\n\nJorgensen Management also failed to pay 69 U.S. workers their required rates, according to the department.\n\n'SCARE TACTICS' IN H-2A PROGRAM, FORMER FARM WORKER SAYS\n\nThe Jorgensen Management H-2A program violations were not surprising, said Irene Ruiz, a bilingual community organizer with the Idaho Organization of Resource Councils and Visi\u00f3n 2C, a farmworker advocacy group in Canyon County.\n\nRuiz was a farmworker in Idaho for 10 years, and the stories of workers being exploited were familiar to her, she said.\n\n\"As a former farmworker, it is disheartening to see workers treated like this,\" Ruiz said. \"These are people who put food on our tables and on our grocery store shelves. They worked through the pandemic, nonstop.\"\n\nThe United Farm Workers, a national farmworker labor union, has urged President Joe Biden's administration to conduct an investigation into the federal H-2A program because of consistent violations.\n\n\"In this case, there was abuse and tactics to scare farm workers into working for less,\" Ruiz said. \"You hear about the scare tactics and intimidation employers use as ways not to pay their workers.\"\n\nThe United Farm Workers sent a letter demanding an investigation into the foreign labor program after reports that said workers in Georgia were required to dig onions up with their bare hands and paid 20 cents per bucket; they were allegedly threatened with guns and violence, according to a VICE news report.",

            "title": "Child workers found throughout Hyundai-Kia supply chain in Alabama",
            "body": "GREENVILLE, Ala. -- At least four major suppliers of Hyundai Motor Co. and sister Kia Corp. have employed child labor at Alabama factories in recent years, a Reuters investigation found, and state and federal agencies are probing whether kids have worked at as many as a half dozen additional manufacturers throughout the automakers' supply chain in the southern U.S. state.\n\nAt a plant owned by Hwashin America Corp, a supplier to the two car brands in the south Alabama town of Greenville, a 14-year-old Guatemalan girl worked this May assembling auto body components, according to interviews with her father and law enforcement officials.\n\nAt plants owned by Korean auto-parts maker Ajin Industrial Co, in the east Alabama town of Cusseta, a former production engineer told Reuters he worked with at least 10 minors. And six other ex-employees of Ajin said they, too, worked alongside multiple underage laborers.\n\nIn two separate statements sent by the same public relations firm, Hwashin and Ajin said their policies forbid the hiring of any worker not of legally employable age. Using identical language, both companies said they hadn't, \"to the best of our knowledge,\" hired underage workers.\n\nThe employment of children at Hwashin and Ajin hasn't been previously reported.\n\nThe news follows a Reuters report in July that revealed the use of child workers, one as young as 12, by SMART Alabama LLC, a Hyundai subsidiary in the south Alabama town of Luverne. In August, the U.S. Department of Labor said that SL Alabama LLC, another Hyundai supplier and a unit of South Korea's SL Corp., employed underage workers, including a 13-year-old, at its factory in Alexander City.\n\nSince then, as many as 10 Alabama plants that supply parts to Hyundai or Kia have been investigated for child labor by various state and federal law enforcement or regulatory agencies, according to two people familiar with the probes.\n\nThe investigations are being conducted across small towns and rural outposts where many of the suppliers and the job recruiters that staff them are located. It isn't yet clear whether the probes will lead to criminal charges, fines or other penalties, the two people said.\n\nOn Aug. 22 a team of Labor Department and Alabama state inspectors arrived unannounced at one of Ajin's plants, according to people familiar with the operation. As the team arrived, workers rushed out the back and left the premises before they could be questioned, one of the inspectors told a meeting of Alabama's anti-human trafficking task force last month, according to two people who attended.\n\nThe inspection hasn't previously been reported.\n\nA Labor Department spokesman, Eric Lucero, told Reuters that the agency's Wage and Hour Division has an open investigation into Ajin, but declined to confirm whether the probe was related to child labor.\n\nIn its statement, Ajin said it \"will cooperate fully\" with any investigations by regulators and law enforcement.\n\nHyundai, in a statement, told Reuters it \"does not condone or tolerate violations of labor law\" and requires that \"our suppliers and business partners strictly adhere to the law.\" Kia, for its part, said it \"strongly condemns any practice of child labor and does not tolerate any unlawful or unethical workplace practices internally or within our business partners and suppliers.\"\n\nHyundai and Kia, South Korea's two largest automakers, are sister companies controlled by parent Hyundai Motor Group. Both companies told Reuters they are reviewing hiring practices used by their suppliers.\n\nThe discovery of child labor at additional plants in Hyundai's American supply chain could deal a fresh reputational blow to a company whose fast growth and popularity in recent years has led it to become the third-largest automaker by U.S. sales.\n\nThe earlier reports of child labor drew law enforcement and regulatory scrutiny to the company's ability to meet its own professed ethical standards and comply with basic labor regulations in the United States.\n\nIn-house human rights policies, posted by both brands online, prohibit child labor at Hyundai and Kia facilities and among their suppliers, too. Alabama and U.S. law restrict factory work for people under age 16, and all workers under 18 are forbidden from many hazardous jobs in auto plants, where metal presses, cutting machines and speeding forklifts can endanger life and limb.\n\nAfter the earlier reporting by Reuters on child labor at suppliers SMART and SL, Hyundai's COO Jose Munoz told the news agency he ordered the carmaker's purchasing department to cease business with the suppliers named in the news reports \"as soon as possible.\" He also said the company would investigate all suppliers to Hyundai's Alabama operations.\n\nHyundai, Munoz added, would seek to end the use of third-party staffing agencies that many of its suppliers have relied upon to vet and hire workers.\n\nHyundai is now backing away from Munoz's remarks.\n\nIn its recent statement to Reuters, Hyundai said it has canceled its plans to cut off suppliers where minors have worked. Two of its suppliers, SMART and SL, have taken \"corrective actions\" to fire staffing agencies they found problematic, it said.\n\nNoting the \"important economic role\" that parts makers play in many small Alabama towns, Hyundai added, \"additional oversight is a better course at this time than severing ties with these suppliers.\"\n\nHyundai declined to make Munoz available for a follow-up interview.\n\nThe use of third-party staffing agencies is a common practice among manufacturers and other labor-intensive sectors throughout the U.S. The tactic has long been criticized by labor activists because it gives factory owners and other employers the ability to outsource responsibility for the screening, hiring and regulatory compliance of their workforces.\n\nEarlier this year, Reuters showed how staffing agencies in rural Alabama recruited undocumented workers from Central America, including minors who had entered the U.S. without parents or guardians, and supplied them to chicken processing plants.\n\nAs with those minors, at least some of the children who worked at Hyundai suppliers used false identities and documentation obtained through black-market brokers, sometimes with the help of staffing firms themselves.\n\nTo understand how child labor took root in the supply chain of one of the world's most successful automakers and in the job market of the world's richest country, Reuters interviewed more than 100 current and former factory workers and managers, labor recruiters, state and federal officials, and others.\n\nReporters spent weeks around auto parts factories in rural Alabama and reviewed thousands of pages of court records, corporate documents, police reports and other records.\n\n\"It's shocking,\" David Weil, a former administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Labor Department, said of the signs of widespread child factory work. \"The ages involved, the danger of what they are being employed to do, it's a clear violation.\"\n\nAcross Alabama, a sprawling and partially interconnected network of suppliers and staffing agencies, many Korean-owned, exists to serve the Hyundai brands. Hyundai operates an assembly plant in Montgomery, the state capital. Kia builds cars across the state line in West Point, Ga.\n\nBoth states, so-called \"right to work\" jurisdictions whose laws allow workers to reject unions and thereby undercut the power of organized labor, have attracted numerous automakers and follow-on investments, as recently as this year, granting them billions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives along the way.\n\nA key element of Hyundai's supply network is its ability to provide \"just-in-time\" delivery of parts, a staple of modern manufacturing meant to minimize stockpiles of materials. To avoid halting assembly lines, Hyundai can fine suppliers - sometimes thousands of dollars per minute - for any delay, according to people familiar with its operations.\n\nPressure to deliver, several current and former employees at suppliers told Reuters, intensified in recent years because of the labor and supply shortages that crippled manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe struggle to meet demand, labor law experts say, has increased chances that employers cut corners to keep assembly lines staffed, whether employees are legally allowed to work or not.\n\n\"It seems like the stage was set for this to happen,\" said Terri Gerstein, director of the state and local enforcement project at Harvard Law School's Labor and Worklife Program. \"Plants in remote, rural areas. A region with low union density. Not enough regulatory enforcement. Use of staffing agencies.\"\n\nThe shortage of labor across manufacturing, and the low pay offered by some plants and agents for factory jobs, often attract job candidates most pressed for work - particularly undocumented migrants and minors.\n\n\"When you have workers who are desperate for jobs and they're not empowered and you have a lot of competition, you often see a race to the bottom,\" said Jordan Barab, a former deputy assistant secretary at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal workplace regulator.\n\nSo far, SL, the manufacturer in the central Alabama town of Alexander City, is the only Hyundai or Kia supplier charged with violating child labor laws. On Aug. 9, state and federal labor and law enforcement officials found seven workers between the ages of 13 and 16 on the SL factory floor, according to people familiar with the operation and government documents.\n\nThe U.S. Labor Department in a court filing said SL Alabama had \"repeatedly violated\" the law \"by employing oppressive child labor.\" It fined the company about $30,000. Alabama's Department of Labor fined SL and one of its staffing agencies a total of about $36,000.\n\nSL told Reuters in October it was cooperating with investigators and auditing its employment policies. The company said it had terminated the staffing agency fined by Alabama labor regulators and fired the president of SL's Alexander City plant. The plant's former president couldn't be reached for comment.\n\nAmong the children found working at the plant, Reuters learned, were two Guatemalan brothers, aged 13 and 15, who were taken into protective custody by federal authorities.\n\nWhile they worked at SL, the brothers lived without their parents, staying with other factory workers in a sparsely furnished house owned by the president of the staffing agency that hired them, according to property records, family members, and a former coworker interviewed at the home in Alabama.\n\nA teenage cousin who worked at the factory with the brothers said that no one at SL ever verified workers' ages.\n\n\"They didn't ask any questions,\" the cousin said.\n\nReuters isn't naming the cousin and other minors and undocumented migrants interviewed for this story, but confirmed their identities and local employment history with authorities.\n\nSince Reuters' first report on child labor in Hyundai's supply chain, staffing firms have fired foreign workers from at least five factories, current and former employees said, particularly any who appeared too young to legally work in the plants. The dismissals make it harder for authorities to investigate, officials said, because the employees may have been working under aliases and some moved away after being fired.\n\nHyundai opened its massive Montgomery vehicle assembly plant in December 2005. The Georgia Kia factory, 100 miles to the east, opened five years later. To support the two brands, many of Hyundai's suppliers from Korea set up in the area, building parts factories that revived local economies. Hyundai and Kia now have dozens of suppliers in Alabama, according to the Economic Development Partnership of Alabama, a business group.\n\nAuthorities first caught wind of child labor among automotive suppliers in early 2021.\n\nA school official in Alabama's rural Butler County told state officials that some children - including at least one immigrant girl around 12 years old - appeared to be working at Hwashin, the parts maker in Greenville. The manufacturer, which builds metallic body parts in a factory the size of four football fields, is now the biggest employer in a town once better known for cotton farming.\n\nAfter the tip, officials familiar with the matter told Reuters they began examining Hwashin. The tipster and the officials spoke on condition they not be identified by name or by agency.\n\nEven as authorities were investigating, a 14-year-old migrant was recruited to the factory floor at Hwashin. The girl's father said he and his daughter arrived in Alabama four years earlier, after a long trek from Guatemala.\n\nThe teen looks younger than her age. On a visit to their home, a small house shared with other migrants south of Greenville, Reuters met the girl, who is just over four feet tall, with rosy cheeks and a timid smile.\n\nEarly this year, the father had been working poultry jobs. Troubled by the family's meager income and hoping to send money to family back in Central America, the girl, who wasn't attending school, asked her father if she too could get a job, he said.\n\nHe agreed. \"I wish I had said no,\" he said.\n\nIn April, the father turned to a Spanish-speaking recruiter who was regularly seeking laborers. The recruiter, the father said, worked for a company he knew as JSS, a name familiar in the area as a staffing agency for Hyundai suppliers. Reuters was unable to reach the recruiter.\n\nAs with many staffing firms, the ownership structure of JSS isn't entirely clear in public records. A review of more than two dozen labor brokers found a complex web of overlapping companies that form and dissolve quickly to serve Hyundai suppliers.\n\nTwo other people, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters they had worked as recruiters for JSS. The agency, they said, hired underage workers while they worked there. Those former recruiters gave Reuters an address in the state capital and said that JSS's top executive, Jae Kim, often worked there.\n\nIn October, Reuters visited the office, located in a Montgomery strip mall. Inside, paperwork and logos for various agencies, including \"JSS Staffing,\" lay on desks. Javier Martinez, an employee, confirmed in a brief interview that the office is run by a businessman named Jae Kim. He said Kim wasn't in that day.\n\nOn LinkedIn, Jae Kim is listed as CEO of a staffing firm called Advanced Job Solutions LLC, or AJS. Kim didn't respond to requests for an interview.\n\nIn Greenville, three miles from the Hwashin factory, a storefront for \"JSS Staffing\" advertised jobs this month in a big window display in Spanish and English. \"Estamos contratando!\" the sign reads. \"NOW HIRING.\" A property manager for the site said the office is rented to a company known as Job Supply System LLC.\n\nIn a phone call to the Greenville office, an attendant referred Reuters back to Martinez, the employee at Kim's office in Montgomery.\n\nMartinez told Reuters by email that he was responding on behalf of Job Supply Systems Alabama LLC, or JSSA - a slight variation on the name of the company renting the Greenville office. Despite the overlap, the firms are different entities, Martinez wrote. Reuters couldn't determine if the agencies shared ownership, management structure or any common history.\n\n\"JSSA is not affiliated with and has no involvement in the management or operations\" of Job Supply System, Martinez wrote. JSSA's policy, he wrote, is \"not to hire, employ, or refer any minor for employment.\" The company, he added, was aware of ongoing child labor investigations and \"has complied with requests from investigators.\"\n\nWhen the Guatemalan girl's father contacted the recruiter, he said he asked whether his daughter's age would be an issue. No, the recruiter told him. On the black market, the girl's father procured a fake ID, seen by Reuters, that says she is an 18-year-old California resident. The name and picture on the card are the daughter's, but the birth year is phony.\n\nBy May, the father said, he and his daughter were both working at Hwashin, each earning about $11 per hour. That's higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 - Alabama doesn't impose a state minimum. But the rate is below what many other industrial jobs in the region pay, including poultry processors, where workers usually earn at least $14 per hour.\n\nFather and daughter worked long shifts, commuting 90 minutes each way from their home, the cost of van rides deducted from their weekly pay, the father said. Many staffing agencies operate van fleets and provide transportation to companies for which they recruit labor.\n\nShortly after father and daughter started, word circulated among factory workers that authorities were planning a crackdown on migrant child labor.\n\nIt isn't clear what prompted the rumors. But months earlier, another young girl from Guatemala, who worked at SMART, the Hyundai-owned supplier in nearby Luverne, disappeared briefly with an adult coworker. That girl's case was detailed in Reuters' first report about child labor among Hyundai suppliers.\n\nBy late May, the father said, his daughter and other minors working at Hwashin were abruptly fired by the staffing agency. \"You've got to leave,\" he said the recruiter told his daughter and other dismissed minors. \"The authorities will be arriving here soon.\"\n\nThe father said he also left Hwashin by early June. At that time, investigators hadn't appeared. Reuters couldn't determine whether authorities have visited the plant since. Hwashin said it isn't aware of any probe of its labor practices and that it would cooperate with any investigation.\n\nSome adult factory workers in Alabama's Hyundai supply chain told Reuters they knew or suspected that children worked alongside them, but feared raising the issue would cost them their jobs.\n\nRaul Roa, a 27-year-old production engineer from Mexico, had arrived in 2020 at the east Alabama town of Cusseta to work at Ajin, one of the two metal stamping plants owned by the Korean parent company of the same name. Roa said Ajin, working with a recruitment firm, secured him a TN visa.\n\nThe visa, a type of entry permit authorized by a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, allows highly skilled professionals from those countries to work in the U.S. Roa was among many Mexican professionals recruited by Hyundai suppliers in recent years, according to interviews, court records, and company documents reviewed by Reuters.\n\nShortly after his arrival, Roa said, he began noticing a significant increase in the number of migrant workers recruited locally. Among them, he suspected, were minors. With time, he got to know some of the younger workers. At least 10 told him they were underage, he said, most of them just 15 or 16 years old.\n\n\"I was very surprised,\" said Roa, who left Ajin earlier this year for a job outside the automotive industry. \"It was my first job in the United States and this is not what you would expect to see here.\"\n\nSix other former workers told Reuters they, too, saw underage workers at Ajin's two factories in Cusseta. All six spoke on condition that they not be identified.\n\nOne of the six former workers, an American manager at one of Ajin's plants, told Reuters he did alert superiors last year to the presence of workers who looked underage. A boss at the plant, he said, dismissed his concerns and advised him to \"focus on production.\"\n\nReuters was unable to reach the superior. Ajin declined to comment on the manager's assertion that a superior had ignored his concerns.\n\nAt SMART, Carlos Herrera, a 29-year-old production engineer, said he heard a similar message.\n\nLike Roa, the Ajin employee, Herrera said he had been recruited by SMART directly from Mexico with a TN visa. After starting at SMART in October 2020, Herrera said he noticed at least 20 young boys and girls working at the plant, many of them from Guatemala. He said some of the minors told him they were between the ages of 12 and 16.\n\nThey worked under fake names, Herrera said, and did the same jobs as adults, some of them even driving forklifts and operating welding equipment.\n\nIn January, Herrera said, he saw a 16-year-old forklift driver sprain his hand after a fall. Another teen, he said, also fell around that time and injured his elbow. Herrera said he raised concerns about the underage workers with managers at SMART, but was brushed off.\n\n\"I would tell them: This person shouldn't be working,\" he said. \"But they didn't care.\"\n\nSMART, in a statement provided by the same public relations firm hired by the other parts makers, said it cut ties with a staffing agency that supplied it with one underage worker. It said it was \"unaware of any evidence\" that any other firm had supplied \"an employee who was not of legally employable age.\"\n\nSMART didn't respond to questions about the injuries Herrera said he saw minors incur at its plant.\n\nSMART makes interior components for popular Hyundai models including the Santa Fe and Elantra, and is majority-owned by the carmaker.\n\nHerrera said on several occasions he saw personnel from Hyundai visit the plant. Other former SMART employees also told Reuters Hyundai officials regularly visited the factory. The officials, wearing shirts that bore Hyundai logos, inspected the assembly line even as underage workers labored there, Herrera said. \"I don't know if they were paying attention to people's faces,\" he said, \"but it was obvious there were minors.\"\n\nHyundai didn't respond to questions about the company's visits to SMART or whether its officials saw underage workers there.\n\nHerrera left SMART earlier this year and is in the process of joining a class action lawsuit filed by a group of TN visa holders against the company and several recruiting firms. The workers allege SMART and its staffing agencies recruited them abroad to come work as engineers but instead assigned them to rote assembly work at the factory. SMART in court documents has called the suit baseless.\n\nAfter Reuters documented the disappearance of the young girl who worked at SMART, a team of state and federal authorities conducted the Aug. 9 inspection at SL, in Alexander City. They discovered seven minors there, including the two Guatemalan brothers, among employees making lights and mirrors for Hyundai and Kia. Alabama's Department of Labor fined SL and JK USA Inc, a staffing agency, $17,800 each.\n\nA state penalty letter against JK is addressed to a top executive of the staffing agency: \"Sam Hong - President.\" Alabama property records show the house where the two brothers lived with other SL workers is owned by a company registered in Sam Hong's name.\n\nBy email this week, Hong said JK is conducting an \"internal investigation.\" He declined to answer detailed questions about the penalty and the company's hiring practices.\n\nOn a Tuesday afternoon in October, Christi Richardson, identified on JK's website as the manager of the firm's Alexander City branch, was packing boxes in the office, located in a small house with a red door. She told Reuters she was closing down the office, and declined to comment further. JK's website is no longer online.\n\nA 4-minute drive away, Reuters visited a ramshackle gray house where the young Guatemalan brothers lived earlier this year. An adult former colleague there said he had been working at the SL plant alongside the boys the day the inspectors came. Wearing a blue, long-sleeve shirt with the JK logo, the man, also Guatemalan, said he no longer worked at SL.\n\nThe day after the kids were found at the plant, he said, SL managers asked all remaining workers to present legitimate documentation. He didn't have proper papers, he said, but soon got a job at another automotive plant nearby.\n\nIn a statement provided by the same public relations agency, SL told Reuters it had ended its relationship with JK. The staffing agency, it added, provided underage workers without SL's \"knowledge, awareness, or consent.\"\n\nBoth of the young Guatemalan brothers crossed the southern U.S. border alone last year, said family members and an official familiar with their entry. They are now at a shelter in Kansas operated by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, or ORR, according to government documents and interviews with family members.\n\nThe agency, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, houses unaccompanied children after they have entered the United States. A spokesperson said the agency can't comment on cases involving migrant minors.\n\nAmong the issues state and federal investigators are now probing is whether children who worked among Hyundai suppliers may have gotten there through human trafficking networks, three people familiar with the investigations said. \"Minor is part of a child labor trafficking case,\" read notes reviewed by Reuters from one of the brothers' ORR case files.\n\nIn the notes, authorities wrote the children described \"exploitation from debt bondage (repaying smuggling debts).\" They added that an unnamed \"third party labor service company\" made the youths believe it could have them removed from the United States.\n\n\"Some children expressed fear of deportation based on comments made by company officials to them,\" the notes said.\n\nFor additional Reuters coverage of the child labor investigations in Alabama, click here.",

            "body": "BRUNSWICK, Ga. - Two men from Brunswick and a third from Jesup, Georgia, were sentenced to federal prison in separate but related human trafficking cases in which they admitted to providing forced labor for south Georgia farms, federal prosecutors said.\n\nJavier Sanchez Mendoza Jr., 24, of Jesup, was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to engage in forced labor; Aurelio Medina, 42, of Brunswick, was sentenced to more than 5 years in prison after pleading guilty to forced labor; and Yordon Velazquez Victoria, 45, of Brunswick, was sentenced to one year and three months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy.\n\nMendoza and Medina are citizens of Mexico illegally present in the United States and are subject to deportation after completion of their prison terms. There is no parole in the federal system.\n\n\"These men engaged in facilitating modern-day slavery,\" U.S. Attorney David H. Estes said in a news release. \"Our law enforcement partners have exposed an underworld of human trafficking, and we will continue to identify and bring to justice those who would exploit others whose labors provide the fuel for their greed.\"\n\nAd\n\nThe Department of Justice release said the cases were charged as part of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force investigation, Operation Blooming Onion, which tracked a wide-ranging conspiracy to bring farmworkers from Central America into the United States under the H-2A visa program under fraudulent pretenses and to profit from their labor by underpaying the workers and keeping them in substandard conditions. The case has been designated as a Priority Transnational Organized Crime Case under the OCDETF program.\n\nAs described in court documents and testimony, Mendoza admitted that from about August 2018 to November 2019, in Glynn, Wayne, and Pierce counties, he was a leader in a venture to obtain and provide labor and services for farms and other businesses. He did so by recruiting and unlawfully charging more than 500 Central American citizens to obtain H-2A visas -- specifically granted for temporary agricultural labor -- and then withholding the workers' identification papers and threatening them and their families in their home countries to force them to work for little or no pay and in deplorable conditions.\n\nAd\n\nA key victim testified during sentencing that Mendoza selected her from another work crew after her arrival in Georgia from Mexico and brought her to live with him, maintaining control through threats and intimidation and raping her repeatedly for more than a year -- including deceiving her into believing she had married him. When she escaped, he kidnapped her at knifepoint from a home where she was babysitting children who were playing in their front yard. Law enforcement agencies tracked her to Mendoza's Jesup mobile home, where after her rescue the officers found a shrine to Santa Muerte -- \"Saint Death\" -- decorated with her hair and blood in what was believed to be a prelude to her murder. Mendoza faces pending state charges for aggravated assault related to that incident.\n\nMedina admitted that from about April to October 2020, in Glynn and Effingham counties, he charged foreign workers to obtain H-2A visas and then withheld their identification documents. Victoria, a naturalized U.S. citizen, admitted he conspired with Medina and allowed Medina to use his name to apply for the use of H-2A workers, and then transported those workers from housing to work for which Victoria was paid $600 per week.\n\nAd\n\nThe investigation into forced labor in agricultural communities, in south Georgia and beyond, continues through U.S.A. v. Patricio et al, in which 23 defendants are charged in the labor trafficking, visa fraud and money laundering conspiracy. The defendants are awaiting trial and are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. Two of those defendants are fugitives.\n\n\"These defendants are being held accountable for the horrors of human and labor trafficking that they inflicted upon their victims, in the name of profit,\" said Special Agent in Charge Katrina Berger, who oversees Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) operations in Georgia and Alabama. \"Thanks to the great work done by our agents, along with our state, local and federal partners, this case was successfully investigated and prosecuted preventing more innocent people from being victimized.\"\n\n\"Customs and Border Protection takes great pride in fostering collaboration with our partner government agencies to diligently combat human trafficking and forced labor as part of our overall duties and responsibilities in protecting and preserving our national security,\" said Henry DeBlock III, Area Port Director for CBP Savannah.\n\nAd\n\n\"This sentencing sends a strong message: DSS pursues those who fraudulently use worker visas, like the H-2A, for personal gain, making sure that those who commit human trafficking face consequences for their criminal actions,\" said Jessica Moore, chief of the criminal investigations division of the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS). \"We are firmly committed to working to prevent situations where vulnerable individuals are exploited in human trafficking schemes such as this. DSS' global presence and strong relationship with the U.S. Attorney's Office and other law enforcement partners was essential in the pursuit of justice for these victims.\"\n\n\"Mendoza, Medina and Victoria misused the H-2A program in order to enrich themselves at the expense of foreign workers and American employers,\" said Mathew Broadhurst, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge, Atlanta Region, U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General. \"We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners and the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division to vigorously pursue those who commit fraud involving foreign labor programs.\"\n\nAd\n\n\"The United States abolished slavery and involuntary servitude over 156 years ago, yet these men engaged in the heinous crime of forced labor and chose to exploit their fellow human beings for profit,\" said Philip Wislar, Acting Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. \"The FBI is committed to working with our partners to purse justice on behalf of victims of human trafficking and prosecuting perpetrators to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\n\"This investigation is an excellent example of a partnership between federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies working together to bring down individuals involved in a human trafficking conspiracy,\" said Tommy D. Coke, Inspector in Charge of the Atlanta Division. \"The hard work and countless hours put forth by all has prevented so many victims from being further victimized by the defendants who have caused considerable emotional harm.\"\n\nThe cases are being investigated as part of an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) operation. OCDETF identifies, disrupts, and dismantles the highest-level criminal organizations that threaten the United States using a prosecutor-led, intelligence-driven, multi-agency approach.\n\nAd\n\nAgencies investigating the cases include Homeland Security Investigations; Customs and Border Protection; U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Fraud Detection and National Security; the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, and Wage and Hour Division; U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; and the FBI.

            "title": "House Passes Bill to Limit Cost of Insulin to $35 a Month",
            "body": "WASHINGTON -- A bill to limit the cost of insulin to $35 a month for most Americans who depend on it passed the House on Thursday, raising Democrats' hopes that the party could take at least one step toward fulfilling its promise of lowering drug costs.\n\nThe bill attracted unanimous support from Democrats who voted, as well as from 12 Republicans, making it a rare piece of bipartisan policy legislation.\n\nTo become law, the bill will need to attract at least 10 Republican votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster. Some lawmakers involved in the effort have expressed optimism that such a coalition might be possible, but few Republican senators have publicly endorsed the bill yet. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has been working with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, on a broader bill related to insulin prices.\n\nThe bill would have substantial benefits for many of the nearly 30 million Americans who live with diabetes. Insulin, a lifesaving drug that is typically taken daily, has grown increasingly expensive in recent years, and many diabetes patients ration their medicines or discontinue them because of the cost. About one in five Americans who take insulin would save money under the proposal, according to a recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nBut the insulin bill represents a substantial scaling back of Democratic ambitions to tackle high drug prices for all Americans. A broader prescription drug package, written as part of the $2.2 trillion social spending and climate bill that has stalled in the Senate, would limit price increases on all prescription drugs, improve the generosity of Medicare's drug coverage, and allow the government to negotiate directly on the price of some drugs used by Medicare patients, while also limiting insulin co-payments.\n\nOther parts of the broader bill would expand health insurance coverage, extending insulin coverage to diabetes patients who are uninsured. The bill that passed the House on Thursday would not improve the affordability of insulin for people who lack health insurance.\n\nThe insulin bill may be the Democrats' best chance of passing part of their popular prescription drug agenda, as the future of the larger package remains unclear.\n\n\"If the effort to address drug prices ends with this plan to cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin, it will amount to crumbs compared to Democrats' initial ambitions to allow the government to negotiate drug prices,\" said Larry Levitt, the executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group.\n\nOn the House floor, several Republicans expressed their opposition to the measure.\n\n\"We all share the goal of reducing the cost of insulin,\" said Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \"This bill, however, is not the right answer.\"\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry opposed the drug price regulations in the social spending and climate legislation, but it has not vocally opposed the insulin bill. While the bill would lower costs for many individual patients who take insulin, it would do nothing to reduce the prices paid to the companies that make it. Instead, insurance companies would simply pay a larger share of the price. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would increase government spending, since health insurers, including Medicare, would be responsible for a greater share of insulin costs.\n\nBut consumer insulin costs have emerged as a politically potent problem, given how widespread diabetes is in the United States, and one that is relatively easier to solve than the prices for prescription drugs overall. At a White House event in December, President Biden centered a speech about prescription drugs around the cost of insulin.\n\n\"I think it's safe to say that all of us, all of us, whatever our background, our age, where we live, we can agree that prescription drugs are outrageously expensive in this country,\" Mr. Biden said at the event, where patients with diabetes told their stories of struggles to afford the medicine.\n\nDebate on the broader legislation has slowed, but has not died. Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia and a key centrist holdout, has expressed support for the prescription drug provisions in the bill, even as he has been more skeptical about other parts of the package.\n\nAt her weekly news conference on Thursday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California tried to cast the passage of the insulin bill as progress toward the party's broader drug-pricing agenda. She described insulin prices as a \"kitchen-table issue.\"\n\n\"It is for us a step in the direction of the secretary being able to negotiate for lower drug prices beyond insulin,\" she added, referring to the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nSenator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and the chairwoman of the Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, is a co-sponsor of similar insulin legislation in her chamber. She said she remained committed to passing a full suite of prescription drug price reforms, but that she viewed the insulin issue as particularly urgent.\n\n\"We're focused on insulin, because it affects so many Americans in so many specific ways,\" she said.\n\nEmily Cochrane contributed reporting.",

            "title": "'Litigation is a certainty': Trump's call to end birthright citizenship would face a mountain of opposition",
            "body": "WASHINGTON -- When Donald Trump took office in 2017, he immediately issued a provocative executive order banning travel from Muslim-majority countries that led to chaos, confusion and a flurry of lawsuits that ended up at the Supreme Court.\n\nIf he wins the election in November, he has pledged to follow a similar course on another contentious policy proposal: ending birthright citizenship.\n\nIn May of last year, Trump released a campaign video renewing his call to end the long-standing constitutional right, saying he would sign an executive order on day one of his presidency that would ensure that children born to parents who do not have legal status in the U.S. will not be considered U.S. citizens.\n\n\"The United States is among the only countries in the world that says even if neither parent is a citizen or even lawfully in the country, their future children are automatic citizens the moment the parents trespass onto our soil,\" Trump said in the video.\n\nBirthright citizenship has long been understood to be required under the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" The language was included in the constitutional amendment enacted after the Civil War to ensure that Black former slaves and their children were recognized as citizens.\n\nThe phrase has been generally understood by legal scholars of all ideological stripes to be self-explanatory, but that has not stopped some anti-immigration advocates from pressing an alternative interpretation.\n\n\"Litigation is a certainty,\" said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union who was also involved in the travel ban challenge.\n\n\"It's directly in the teeth of the 14th Amendment,\" he added. \"It would essentially be an attempt to tear down one of the core constitutional protections that has been a key part of our country.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court ultimately upheld a watered-down version of Trump's travel ban, deferring to the president's authority on national security issues, but even supporters of birthright citizenship accept Trump's plan would face a potentially insurmountable uphill battle.\n\n\"It's something that the Supreme Court may well decide against the president if he were to take this step,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, who supports the idea.\n\nIf Trump loses that case, then the next step is clear, he added: There would need to be an effort to start the difficult process of amending the Constitution.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesman declined to comment on the plan, pointing to the former president's original announcement.\n\nUnder Trump's proposal, at least one parent would need to be a citizen or legal resident for a child to receive birthright citizenship. He indicated in his video that the policy would not apply retroactively.\n\nThe order, Trump said, would also address so-called \"birth tourism,\" a situation in which Republicans claim people visit the U.S. toward the end of a pregnancy in order to ensure the child is born a U.S. citizen.\n\nIt is unclear exactly how many children a year are born in the U.S. to parents who are both undocumented or how many of them could be described as \"birth tourists\" under Trump's formulation.\n\nKrikorian's group has previously said that there could be up to 400,000 children born a year to undocumented parents and thousands of children born as a result of birth tourism every year.\n\nThe American Immigration Council, an immigrant rights group, said it does not have exact numbers but noted that there are currently an estimated 3.7 million U.S.-born children who have at least one parent who is undocumented, a number derived from U.S. census data.\n\nA spokesperson for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that handles citizenship issues, declined to comment.\n\nTrump had pledged to end birthright citizenship when first running for president in 2015 and he raised it again in 2018. But he never issued an executive order.\n\nAt the time, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Republican, dismissed the idea, saying: \"You can't do something like this via executive order.\"\n\nDespite Trump's pledge, the plan to end birthright citizenship is not specifically mentioned in the 2024 Republican platform document, which includes a chapter titled \"Seal the Border and Stop the Migrant Invasion.\"\n\nThe platform does include language pledging to \"prioritize merit-based immigration\" and end chain migration, a term used to refer to people who have U.S. citizenship and then use their status to help other family members enter the country.\n\nKen Cuccinelli, who held a senior Department of Homeland Security position in the first Trump administration, said the proposal is \"appropriate and manageable from a policy perspective\" but did not respond to further questions on how it could be lawfully implemented.\n\nCuccinelli wrote the chapter on immigration-related issues that was included in Project 2025, a proposed road map for a second Trump administration issued by the conservative Heritage Foundation. His section did not mention birthright citizenship.\n\n\"As has been laid out by many scholars, this current policy is based on a historical myth and a willful misinterpretation of the law by the open borders advocate,\" Trump said of birthright citizenship in his announcement video.\n\nFew people agree with that assessment.\n\nThe legal argument, fleshed out by anti-immigration advocates, focuses on the language in the 14th Amendment saying that birthright citizenship is awarded to those \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States.\n\nOpponents of birthright citizenship say that language means citizenship is denied to anyone whose parents are not legally in the country.\n\n\"Illegal aliens can hardly be said to be under the protection of the United States,\" said Christopher Hajec, a lawyer at the Immigration Reform Law Institute, another anti-immigration group.\n\nBut most legal experts say the jurisdiction language only refers to people not bound by U.S. law, most notably foreign diplomats.\n\nEven James Ho, a conservative lawyer whom Trump appointed to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals where he has built a reputation as a judicial firebrand, backs that view.\n\nHe wrote in a 2009 article that the 14th Amendment citizenship language applies to \"most U.S.-born children of aliens, including illegal aliens.\"\n\nBeing within the jurisdiction of the U.S. merely means people who are required to obey U.S. laws, Ho said. \"And obedience, of course, does not turn on immigration status,\" he added.\n\nThe Supreme Court has never directly ruled on the issue, but the one case that is frequently mentioned in any discussion of the issue suggested that it was assumed people born in the U.S. have citizenship, whatever the status of their parents.\n\nIn that 1898 case, called United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the court ruled that a man born in San Francisco to parents who were both from China was a U.S. citizen.\n\nBirthright citizenship critics argue that the ruling did not address whether the children of people who entered the country illegally are U.S. citizens, as the parents in that case had been lawfully admitted.\n\nIn fact, they suggest the ruling assumes that the children of people who enter the country illegally do not have citizenship, although they concede that the argument can be difficult to follow.\n\n\"You really have to tease it out,\" Hajec said. \"It's a pretty complicated argument.\"\n\nIf Trump were to follow through on his plan to issue an executive order on day one, the impact could be felt immediately.\n\nThe Trump campaign has said the president would order the Social Security Administration to refuse to issue Social Security numbers to newborn children without proof of the parents' immigration status. He would issue a similar order to the State Department regarding passports.\n\nKrikorian, who said he has not discussed the policy with the Trump campaign, favors that approach as it would not require any action from Congress and would immediately prompt a lawsuit that would get the legal issue before the Supreme Court in short order.\n\nIn the unlikely event that Trump's plan were to go fully into effect, it could be tricky to implement because federal agencies do not necessarily have immigration status at their fingertips and would need to access information not just on the newly born child but also data on both parents. Sometimes relevant information could be hard to determine, such as if the immigration status of an absent parent is not known to the other.\n\nA Social Security Administration spokeswoman noted that the agency does not hold data on immigration status, which it has to verify with the Department of Homeland Security before issuing immigrants a Social Security number.\n\nCurrently, a U.S. birth certificate is all that is needed to obtain a Social Security number or passport.\n\nEmma Winger, a lawyer at the American Immigration Council, said that Trump's proposal would affect any child born in the United States, as every parent would now need to take an additional bureaucratic step to ensure that their baby is registered as a citizen.\n\n\"Everybody relies on the fact that if they are born here they just need to show proof of birth,\" she said. \"It would be a radical shift.\"",

            "title": "Insurers Will Have to Cover 8 At-Home Virus Tests Per Month",
            "body": "WASHINGTON -- Private insurers will soon have to cover the cost of eight at-home coronavirus tests per member per month, the Biden administration said Monday.\n\nPeople will be able to get the tests at their health plan's \"preferred\" pharmacies and other retailers with no out-of-pocket costs, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. They can also buy the tests elsewhere and file claims for reimbursement, just as they often do for medical care.\n\n\"Today's action further removes financial barriers and expands access to Covid-19 tests for millions of people,\" Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the Biden administration's Medicare and Medicaid chief, said in a statement about the new guidelines.\n\nRoughly 150 million Americans, or about 45 percent of the population, are privately insured, mostly through their employers. Each enrolled dependent of the primary insurance holder counts as a member.\n\nAt out-of-network facilities, insurers' responsibility would be capped at $12 per test, meaning people could be responsible for any additional costs.\n\nBut if a health plan does not establish a network of \"preferred\" retailers where patients can get tests covered upfront, it will be responsible for whatever claims its patients submit for their eight monthly rapid tests, with no limit on the price.\n\nSabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms, said the policy could save families hundreds of dollars a month.\n\n\"I would love to see a more comprehensive national testing policy where these tests are free for everybody, regardless of insurance status,\" she said. \"Will it help everybody? No. It is definitely not the ideal way to lower barriers to Covid testing. But it is helpful.\"\n\nRapid at-home tests are typically sold in packs of two, ranging in cost from about $14 to $34. That can be prohibitively expensive, especially when tests are purchased in bulk.\n\nOther countries have spent more heavily on rapid testing. In Britain, citizens can use a government website to order free rapid tests for home use. Germany invested hundreds of millions of dollars to create a network of 15,000 rapid testing sites. The United States has instead focused public purchasing on vaccines, and efforts to encourage their uptake.\n\nSome local governments in the United States have invested heavily in rapid testing to counter the latest wave of cases. Washington, D.C., which has experienced a substantial surge in virus cases, now allows residents to pick up four free rapid tests daily at libraries across the city.\n\nThe new Biden policy will not apply retroactively to at-home tests that Americans have already purchased. Tests ordered or administered by health providers will continue to be covered by insurance without any co-payment or deductible under a law requiring insurers to fully cover tests at doctor's offices, public sites and other facilities.\n\nThe administration is working on other efforts to get coronavirus tests to people regardless of their insurance status, including a plan to deliver 500 million free rapid tests to the homes of Americans who order them, starting later this month.\n\nThat plan, along with the new rules for insurers announced Monday, is part of a broader effort by the Biden administration in recent weeks to catch up to skyrocketing demand for rapid tests, as virus cases have exploded around the nation with the arrival of the highly contagious Omicron variant.\n\nThe Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest UpdatesUpdated Jan. 10, 2022, 7:23 p.m. ETU.S. hospitalizations have surpassed last winter's peak.U.S. insurers must cover 8 at-home tests per member each month.Massachusetts extends its mask mandate in schools through Feb. 28.\n\nThe administration has also announced plans to make tens of millions of free tests available for uninsured Americans at health clinics and other sites in underserved communities. And it has recently opened federally run test sites in hard-hit regions of the country.\n\nMatt Eyles, president of the health insurer trade group America's Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement that insurance companies would \"work as quickly as possible to implement this guidance.\"\n\n\"While there will likely be some hiccups in early days, we will work with the administration to swiftly address issues as they arise,\" he said.\n\nSupplies of the tests at pharmacies and grocery stores all but dried up last month as Omicron descended, and manufacturers are racing to restock shelves, a scramble that has prompted some experts to criticize the administration for being caught flat-footed.\n\nThe low availability could hinder the rollout of the reimbursement policy, said Lindsey Dawson, a policy analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation who has researched the availability of rapid tests.\n\n\"If reimbursement exists but there aren't tests to purchase,\" she said, \"that doesn't help an individual consumer.\"\n\nShe added, \"The policy could certainly drive demand, and could exacerbate the problem.\"\n\nMs. Dawson said prices have begun climbing at some major retailers, such as Walmart. That could mean significant upfront costs for families who have to file claims for reimbursement, she said.\n\nThe Coronavirus Pandemic: Key Things to KnowCard 1 of 3\n\nThe latest Covid data in the U.S. As the Omicron surge causes case counts to reach record highs and hospitalizations to surpass the height of the Delta wave, here's how to think about the data and what it's beginning to show about Omicron's potential toll across the county.\n\nAround the world. In Europe, Germany is bracing for major protests against restrictions after thousands took to the streets in France and Austria, and a tough new vaccine requirement came into force in Italy. In Uganda, schools reopened after the longest pandemic-prompted shutdown in the world.\n\nStaying safe. Worried about spreading Covid? Keep yourself and others safe by following some basic guidance on when to test and how to use at-home virus tests (if you can find them). Here is what to do if you test positive for the coronavirus.\n\nSome health plans also expressed concern about the potential lack of supply when the policy rolls out in less than a week.\n\n\"We are concerned that the policy does not solve for the limited supply of tests in the country and could cause additional consumer friction as insurers stand up a program in just four days' time,\" Kim Keck, the chief executive of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.\n\nMs. Corlette, the Georgetown researcher, pointed to several other potential problems with the new policy. The guidance is not explicit about how insurers should design reimbursement systems, so they could make the process onerous, with less user-friendly websites and more hoops to jump through. Nor is there a deadline by which reimbursement must occur.\n\nShe added that the policy will exist only for the duration of the Covid-19 public health emergency.\n\nDozens of Democratic lawmakers wrote to President Biden on Sunday pressing him to expand access to rapid tests, including by manufacturing enough for every American to take at least one a week. They also warned that insurance reimbursement can be time-consuming and could discourage people who are less well off from buying tests.\n\nWhen Mr. Biden announced the reimbursement plan in early December, he drew skepticism from some public health experts who wondered why the United States was not buying tests in bulk and offering them at little to no cost, as European countries have done.\n\nAt the time, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, dismissed the idea of a sprawling program to provide free tests to Americans.\n\nBut as the administration faced intensifying criticism, Mr. Biden announced that his administration would offer 500 million free at-home tests for the nation's 330 million residents, available to order through a website that is supposed to debut this month.\n\nThere will also be a hotline that people can call if they do not have access to a computer or prefer to order tests by phone, a White House official said.\n\nThe administration is racing to sign a series of test contracts with companies already in possession of tests, or with manufacturers; the first two were announced on Friday.\n\nMore agreements will be announced in the coming days, officials said. Biden administration officials have said they are being careful not to appropriate tests that are already set to be delivered to retailers like CVS and Walgreens.\n\nIt remains unclear how many tests each household will be able to order as part of the program, and what brands will be offered through it. The F.D.A. has authorized more than a dozen at-home antigen tests, including some under a new accelerated review program the federal government announced last year.\n\nThe success of the administration's efforts to get more tests to Americans could also be complicated by preliminary research suggesting that rapid antigen tests may miss some Omicron infections even when people are carrying high levels of the virus. That has prompted scientists to warn about misinterpreting negative results when they have symptoms or may have been exposed to the virus. Experts have continued to recommend using the tests.",

            "title": "Expanded Safety Net Drives Sharp Drop in Child Poverty",
            "body": "WASHINGTON -- For a generation or more, America's high levels of child poverty set it apart from other rich nations, leaving millions of young people lacking support as basic as food and shelter amid mounting evidence that early hardship leaves children poorer, sicker and less educated as adults.\n\nBut with little public notice and accelerating speed, America's children have become much less poor.\n\nA comprehensive new analysis shows that child poverty has fallen 59 percent since 1993, with need receding on nearly every front. Child poverty has fallen in every state, and it has fallen by about the same degree among children who are white, Black, Hispanic and Asian, living with one parent or two, and in native or immigrant households. Deep poverty, a form of especially severe deprivation, has fallen nearly as much.\n\nIn 1993, nearly 28 percent of children were poor, meaning their households lacked the income the government deemed necessary to meet basic needs. By 2019, before temporary pandemic aid drove it even lower, child poverty had fallen to about 11 percent.\n\nMore than eight million children remained in poverty, and despite shared progress, Black and Latino children are about three times as likely as white children to be poor. With the poverty line low (about $29,000 for a family of four in a place with typical living costs), many families who escape poverty in the statistical sense still experience hardship.\n\nStill, the sharp retreat of child poverty represents major progress and has drawn surprisingly little notice, even among policy experts.\n\nIt has coincided with profound changes to the safety net, which at once became more stringent and more generous. Starting in the 1990s, tough welfare laws shrank cash aid to parents without jobs. But other subsidies grew, especially for working families, and total federal spending on low-income children roughly doubled.\n\nTo examine the drop in child poverty, The New York Times collaborated with Child Trends, a nonpartisan research group with an expertise in statistical analysis. The joint project relied on the data the Census Bureau uses to calculate poverty rates but examined it over more years and in greater demographic detail.\n\nThe analysis found that multiple forces reduced child poverty, including lower unemployment, increased labor force participation among single mothers and the growth of state-level minimum wages. But a dominant factor was the expansion of government aid.\n\nIn 1993, safety net programs cut child poverty by 9 percent from what it would have been absent the aid. By 2019, those programs had cut child poverty by 44 percent, and the number of children they removed from poverty more than tripled to 6.5 million.\n\n\"This is an astounding decline in child poverty,\" said Dana Thomson, a co-author of the Child Trends study. \"Its magnitude is unequaled in the history of poverty measurement, and the single largest explanation is the growth of the safety net.\"\n\nRenee Ryberg, another co-author, said the poverty reduction offered millions of children greater prospects of success. \"A childhood free of poverty predicts better adult outcomes in just about every area you can imagine, including education, earnings and health,\" she said.\n\nThe analysis excluded 2020, the most recent year for which data is available, because pandemic aid made it unrepresentative. Including it makes the decline since 1993 even greater, at 69 percent.\n\nThe plunge in child poverty is the opposite of what most liberal experts predicted a quarter-century ago when President Bill Clinton signed a law from a Republican Congress to \"end welfare as we know it.\"\n\nConservatives say the landmark law pushed more parents to work and call it the main reason child poverty declined. Progressives say many working families would still be poor without the expanded safety net, which grew in part to compensate for stagnant wages amid decades of rising inequality.\n\nA patchwork of programs shaped by a century of political conflict and compromise, the safety net bears the imprint of both parties and commands the satisfaction of neither. Most Republicans want less spending, more local control and more rules requiring beneficiaries to work. Most Democrats want higher benefits for more people, as seen in their unsuccessful push this year to permanently turn the child tax credit, a workers' subsidy, into a broader income guarantee.\n\nCritics of all sorts, including those getting aid, complain of red tape.\n\nYet whatever its flaws, the safety net depicted in the Child Trends data lifts a record share of children from poverty. \"The federal government declared war on poverty, and poverty won,\" President Ronald Reagan said a generation ago. With child poverty at a record low, that narrative of defeat appears obsolete.\n\n\"This decline in child poverty is very significant. I cannot say it enough,\" said Dolores Acevedo-Garcia, a poverty expert at Brandeis University who reviewed the data. \"If we still had the rates as we had in the 1990s, there would be 12 million more children in poverty.\"\n\nTo see how the safety net protects children, consider the experience of Stacy Tallman, a mother of three in Marlinton, W.Va., who was working as a waitress last year when her teenage son, Jakob, suffered serious injuries in a car accident. Both Ms. Tallman and her partner, who has a maintenance job, missed work to care for him, and their income fell by about a quarter to $36,000.\n\nAfter payroll taxes and other expenses the government takes into account when measuring poverty, their income was just below the poverty line. But the safety net delivered more than $16,000, not counting pandemic assistance. That included $8,000 in refundable tax credits and $6,500 from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps.\n\nInstead of falling into poverty, the family survived the crisis about 50 percent above the poverty threshold.\n\n\"I don't know where I'd be right now if I didn't have that help,\" Ms. Tallman said.\n\nMedicaid paid for Jakob's care and saved the family from bankrupting medical bills. SNAP, the food subsidy, eased Ms. Tallman's anxiety about the children going hungry, as did free school meals. Tax credits helped her complete a longstanding plan to buy the family's first house.\n\nA year after the accident, Jakob became the first in the family to earn a high school degree.\n\nMore Work Rules, More Aid\n\nIn measuring poverty, the analysis used the Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure, the yardstick that best accounts for government aid. Unlike the outdated Official Poverty Measure, the supplemental measure counts billions in tax credits, SNAP and other benefits, and adjusts for local living costs, providing a more accurate tally of household resources. While 2009 is the earliest year for which the Census Bureau produced the supplemental measure, researchers at Columbia University calculated it for earlier decades, and Child Trends drew on their data.\n\nWhile the official measure shows child poverty falling 37 percent from a 1993 peak, the supplemental measure shows a 59 percent decline.\n\nMost of the decline occurred in two periods of strong labor demand -- the late 1990s and late 2010s -- with poverty largely flat in between, even though that period includes the Great Recession.\n\nIn the two years before the pandemic, child poverty fell more than a quarter, a record pace.\n\nThe analysis examined multiple factors beyond the safety net that collectively explain about a fifth of the poverty decline. They included lower unemployment and a 23 percent increase in the average minimum wage, driven by state-level growth. (Adjusted for inflation, the federal minimum wage eroded.)\n\nAt the same time, the growing proportion of children who are part of Hispanic families and immigrant families appeared to slow the poverty decline, perhaps because those families face job discrimination or barriers to aid.\n\nThe decline of child poverty coincides with progress on another measure of children's well-being. The share who lack health insurance fell by about two-thirds, mostly because of expansions of Medicaid and other government insurance. While those programs often improve children's health, they do not directly reduce poverty because the government does not count insurance as income.\n\nIn comparing 1993 and 2019, the study examined different points in the business cycle -- unemployment in the latter year was about half the earlier rate. That highlights the economy's role in reducing poverty, but the analysis still found the aid expansion more important.\n\nArguing that the welfare law reduced child poverty, conservatives note the subsequent surge of employment among single mothers, the group most affected by restrictions on cash aid. The share of single mothers in the work force leaped to 79 percent, from 69 percent in the early '90s.\n\n\"The system sent a message: You can't live on welfare anymore,\" said Robert Rector, a poverty researcher at the Heritage Foundation.\n\nMost researchers think multiple forces explained rising work levels, including a strong economy and expanded tax credits, which made work more rewarding. Still many parents moved into jobs that paid poverty-level wages absent government help. The analysis found that increased labor force participation alone explained about 9 percent of the decline in child poverty.\n\nWhile Mr. Rector agreed that tax credits magnified the poverty reduction, he argued that the era's success shows that aid should be linked to work. \"The lesson isn't that 'aid works' -- it's that some aid is very harmful and some aid is helpful,\" he said.\n\nWhatever role the employment of single mothers played, it peaked by about 2000, while child poverty fell by another third. \"Other factors had to be responsible,\" Ms. Ryberg said, pointing to the continued safety net expansion.\n\nAn Effective Patchwork\n\nAlmost every program that Child Trends examined does more to reduce child poverty than it did a quarter-century ago, either because it raised benefits, expanded eligibility or made it easier to enroll.\n\nBut each program expanded in its own way -- some by congressional intent (tax credits) and others by demographic change (Social Security) or court order (Supplemental Security Income, which provides disability aid). A primary goal was to help low-wage workers, but there were also major expansions of programs with few if any work rules (SNAP and school meals).\n\nThe story of the safety net, in other words, is a story of safety nets -- multiple programs with multiple aims, sometimes evolving in uncoordinated or accidental ways.\n\n\"The safety net is often criticized for being a patchwork of programs, but that's also a strength,\" Ms. Thomson said. \"It reaches a variety of people in a variety of circumstances.\"\n\nThe aid is often large. The average family lifted out of poverty received nearly $18,000 in benefits -- more than 40 percent of its after-tax income.\n\nNothing better shows the aid expansion than the growth of two wage subsidies: the earned-income tax credit, which expanded greatly in the 1990s, and the child tax credit, which only recently extended significant help to low-income families.\n\nBy 2019, a parent who had two children and worked full time at the average minimum wage could receive about $8,300 from the programs -- more than three times as much as in 1993, adjusted for inflation. The earned-income credit alone reduced child poverty by 22 percent, the analysis found, compared with 5 percent a generation ago.\n\nMishala Southwick of Okmulgee, Okla., considers the tax credits essential to her children's futures. A receptionist at an auto body shop, she expects to earn about $30,000 this year while her husband cares for their 2-year-old twin daughters. Absent aid, their net income would leave them poor. With $9,000 in tax credits, they are not.\n\nMs. Southwick, 22, a member of the Muscogee Nation, uses much of the money to repair the dilapidated house on the reservation that she rents from her father and hopes to buy. \"I have a 10-year plan for the house, and it all depends on the tax income,\" she said. She installed central heating because she feared her daughters would start a fire playing with the space heaters. \"It feels a lot more safe,\" she said.\n\nShe also provided them savings accounts, hoping they find the upward mobility that so far has eluded her. After scoring high on a college-entrance exam, Ms. Southwick wanted to be a math professor, but early pregnancy and lack of money derailed her college plans. The accounts remind her of her faded aspirations.\n\n\"I just want them to have a better chance,\" she said of her children.\n\nAnother program with growing impact is SNAP, which cut child poverty by 11 percent in 2019, compared with 5 percent a generation ago. While benefits changed little, eligibility grew, and enrollment swelled after bipartisan efforts in the early 2000s to make the program easier to use. An expanded school lunch program, which allows more schools to provide all students free meals, has also become a growing anti-poverty force.\n\nAmong the programs that most affected children is one aimed at retirees. Social Security cut child poverty by 14 percent, more than twice as much as it did a quarter-century ago, both because benefits grew and because more children now live with elderly parents or grandparents.\n\nCash aid -- now called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families -- is the rare program whose anti-poverty effect seemingly declined. Benefits withered and enrollment plunged, as work rules made aid harder to get. But the analysis counts only the money the program provided, not whether it led more families to work and escape poverty on their own.\n\n\"It's not just about the amount of dollars that flow into households from the program itself,\" said Robert Doar, the president of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"It's about sending a message that going to work is the path out of poverty. That message got through.\"\n\nMr. Doar said the welfare law, by encouraging work, made policymakers more inclined to support other aid expansions.\n\n\"If you work, we will help you -- Americans like that message,\" he said.\n\nWhile critics feared welfare limits would hurt the poor during recessions, the safety net performed better than in the past downturns -- an unexpected finding. Even during the Great Recession, the worst economic crisis in 80 years, child poverty rose by just 4 percent (in part because Congress approved temporary help).\n\nLikewise, despite fears of a rise in deep poverty (living on less than half the poverty line) has fallen by 56 percent.\n\nWhile the Census Bureau's methods tend to underestimate aid from some programs (SNAP) and overestimate others (tax credits), Robert Greenstein, a researcher at the Brookings Institution, said technical adjustments would not undercut the findings.\n\n\"The decline in child poverty is very, very impressive, and it is overwhelmingly due to the increased effectiveness of government programs,\" he said.\n\nRacial and Ethnic Gaps Remain\n\nIt may seem obvious that poverty hurts children. But researchers have long debated whether poverty itself harms children or if conditions that harm children, like parental addiction or depression, cause poverty. A panel of scholars, reviewing the evidence in 2019, forged a consensus: \"poverty itself causes negative child outcomes,\" and safety net programs \"improve child well-being.\" Aid helps children, they found, both by increasing what families can buy and by reducing severe levels of parental stress.\n\nRuth Raudales, a single mother in Houston, appreciates aid for both its material and psychological rewards. Ms. Raudales, 23, works part time and attends college while living with her mother, brother, and 4-year-old son. After taxes and expenses, household earnings of $32,000 would leave them poor, but with tax credits and other help they are not.\n\nA legal immigrant from Honduras, Ms. Raudales arrived too recently to qualify for SNAP and hesitated to apply for her American-born son for fear it would harm her citizenship application. But she changed her mind after unexpected expenses left her worried about running out of food.\n\nAsked what difference SNAP made, Ms. Raudales recited the bonanza of fruit she buys, then resorted to a Honduran idiom -- literally, \"we're breathing\" -- that translates colloquially as \"we're able to get by.\"\n\n\"Before I had the SNAP, I was always afraid,\" she said. \"Now it's like if something happens, we'll be OK.\"\n\nIn 1993, 49 percent of Black children and 52 percent of Hispanic children were poor -- figures that now look like misprints. While poverty among both groups has plunged, gaps with white children remain.\n\n\"The decline in child poverty deserves to be lauded, but these disparities diminish the sense of progress,\" said Starsky Wilson, the president of the Children's Defense Fund.\n\nLikewise, poverty fell at equal rates among immigrant and nonimmigrant households, but the children of foreign-born parents were almost twice as likely to be poor. That is partly because they have less access to aid. Most programs deny aid to undocumented migrants, and some restrict certain legal immigrants, too.\n\nBanning assistance to the undocumented is meant to discourage illegal immigration. But many undocumented parents have American-born children affected by the limits on aid. Ms. Acevedo-Garcia, the Brandeis professor, found that 21 percent of poor children have an undocumented parent, and most of those children are citizens.\n\n\"They are here to stay,\" she said.\n\nDespite its progress, the United States still has more child poverty than many peer nations, though its rank depends on how poverty is defined.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental group, ranks the United States 36th out of 41 countries, defining poor children as those with less than half their country's median income. But since the United States is unusually wealthy, its poor children may have higher incomes than some nonpoor children abroad.\n\nThe United States looks better in comparisons that use the American poverty line as a common standard. Yet even with that definition, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2019 found the United States ranked fourth among five rich English-speaking countries, trailing Australia, Canada and Ireland.\n\n\"We could do a lot better,\" said Hilary Hoynes, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, though she hailed the progress as evidence that solutions can be found.\n\n\"When we spend money, we make gains,\" she said. \"Providing more resources to low-income families changes children's life trajectories.\"",

            "title": "U.S. Is Said to Consider Reinstating Detention of Migrant Families",
            "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration is considering reviving the practice of detaining migrant families who cross the border illegally -- the same policy the president shut down over the past two years because he wanted a more humane immigration system, officials familiar with the discussions said Monday.\n\nAlthough no final decision has been made, the move would be a stark reversal for President Biden, who came into office promising to adopt a more compassionate approach to the border after his predecessor, former President Donald J. Trump, introduced a series of harsh immigration policies.\n\nThe Biden administration has largely ended the practice of family detention, instead releasing families into the United States temporarily and using ankle bracelets, traceable cellphones or other methods to keep track of them.\n\nBut the administration has turned to more restrictive measures as it struggles to quell a rise in migrants fleeing authoritarian governments and economic ruin in their countries. Officials also fear a surge at the border after May 11, when a public health measure that has allowed authorities to swiftly expel migrants expires.\n\nMr. Biden's tough new measures, including a crackdown announced last month that could disqualify a vast majority of migrants from being able to seek asylum at the southern border, have infuriated advocates who say the president is breaking campaign promises and embracing a Trump-era approach to immigration.\n\n\"Ending the inhumane practice of family detention has been one of the only positive immigration policy decisions of the Biden administration,\" said Leecia Welch, a lead lawyer in the case that led to the 1997 Flores settlement, which limits the time children can spend in detention and establishes minimum standards for holding facilities.\n\n\"It is heartbreaking to hear there could be a return to the Trump-era use of this practice,\" she said.\n\nMore on U.S. ImmigrationChild Labor: The Biden administration announced a crackdown on the labor exploitation of migrant children and members of Congress began pressing for stricter laws, after a Times investigation showed the explosive growth of migrant child labor throughout the United States.Leaving the U.S.: Crowded scenes at the border do not necessarily translate into an increase in the undocumented population. Many other immigrants have been returning to their countries of origin.A Rare Victory: Nearly 100 immigrants who were rounded up during a 2018 raid at a meat processing plant in Tennessee have reached a $1.17 million settlement against the U.S. government and federal agents, who they said used racial profiling and excessive force during the operation.New Asylum Rules: A tough new measure proposed by U.S. officials could disqualify the vast majority of migrants from being able to seek asylum at the southern border.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. The administration has previously denied any resemblance to Mr. Trump's policies, citing the creation of new legal pathways for migrants from certain countries.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said no decisions had been made as the administration prepared for the end of the public health measure, known as Title 42.\n\n\"The administration will continue to prioritize safe, orderly and humane processing of migrants,\" Luis Miranda, a department spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nBut senior White House and homeland security immigration advisers have held several meetings over the past few days to discuss their options, including reinstating the family detention policy, according to five current and former administration officials with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nThe officials said the Department of Homeland Security is outlining what it would need to do to restart family detention by May 11.\n\nOne of the officials cautioned that the administration would follow the law that sets a 20-day limit for detaining families, rather than holding them for weeks or even months as previous administrations did. Another option would be continuing the practice in place now -- releasing families into the country, where they would be tracked and required to report to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, the official said.\n\nHow Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes.

But the practice has long been controversial, in part because of years of scientific consensus that detaining minors, even with their parents, can cause developmental damage.\n\nTwo of the federal government's medical consultants in 2018 said they identified a \"high risk of harm\" to migrant children at the facilities. The consultants uncovered serious problems, including a child who lost a third of his body weight and an infant with bleeding of the brain that went undiagnosed for five days.\n\nFamily detention was also used by former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Both faced criticism for the conditions in which they held migrant families. One facility in New Mexico was forced to close in 2014 after complaints about the conditions there.\n\nThe Trump administration tried to expand the practice and detain families indefinitely to discourage migrants from crossing illegally. But Mr. Trump's attempts to end limits on how long minors could be held were blocked by the courts.\n\nThe Biden administration would face serious logistical obstacles in reinstating family detention, starting with finding space to hold families. The facilities also would need to be set up to provide educational programs and playgrounds. The spaces that previously housed families are now used for single adults.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, which oversees the detention network, is already facing a budget shortfall in the hundreds of millions.\n\nThe plan also assumes that government officials would be able to screen families for asylum quickly, admitting them or deporting them within the 20-day window. The average stay in an ICE detention center is about 37 days, according to internal data. In addition, there will never be enough space to detain all migrant families, the officials said. And the government would need a much larger fleet of planes to deport everyone.\n\nThree of the officials who spoke to The New York Times described concerns that family detention would encourage parents to send their children to the U.S. border alone instead of risking detention as a family. Children who arrive in the United States without a parent or legal guardian are not expelled. Instead, they are placed in government custody and eventually released to live with a family member or other sponsor. That program, overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, has come under recent scrutiny after a New York Times investigation revealed many migrant children released to sponsors and family members are working dangerous jobs that violate child labor laws.\n\nCritics of family detention say that putting families in the position of deciding to send their children to the United States without them is simply de facto family separation, a harsh measure used during the Trump administration when 5,500 children were separated from parents at the southern border under Mr. Trump's \"zero-tolerance\" policy. Mr. Biden and other Democrats have railed against the practice and pledged not to restart it.\n\nAside from the humanitarian implications, the family detention policy would carry political risk for Mr. Biden. Republicans have called for stricter immigration measures, accusing the president of having an \"open borders\" policy.\n\nBut Mr. Biden would almost certainly feel political blowback from Democrats.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Mr. Biden campaigned against the Trump administration's use of family detention.\n\n\"Children should be released from ICE detention with their parents immediately,\" he wrote in a June 2020 Twitter post after a federal judge ordered the release of migrant children from detention facilities because of the coronavirus pandemic. \"This is pretty simple, and I can't believe I have to say it: Families belong together.\"\n\nMr. Biden's Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, has considered ending family detention one of the department's key accomplishments under his leadership. In addition, the administration justified ending family detention in its 2023 fiscal year funding request: \"To ensure a more humane treatment of families,\" it wrote, \"the administration is de-emphasizing family detention practices.\"",
