When you step back and you look at tax policy through the years, that corporate tax cut was enormous. It’s a huge amount of money and corporations are a difficult thing to conceptualize. Like, what does that mean? Who does it go to? Well, it goes to the shareholders. Well, who holds the shares?\\n\\nWell, teachers and pensioners. But, you know, okay, sure. But are they really seeing the benefit? Like, first of all, describe how big the cut was and what are the effects of it?\\n\\nKimberly Clausing: Yeah. So the cut was from 35 percent statutory rate to a 21 percent statutory rate. But one thing to bear in mind is that the biggest companies are really not paying at the statutory rate, in part because they’re operating throughout the world and they can easily arrange their financial affairs, so a lot of the income ends up offshore at a lower tax rate.\\n\\nBut if you look at sort of what it did to taxes received as a share of GDP, we were averaging about 2 percent of corporate taxes as a share of GDP and that fell to the neighborhood of 1 percent due to this agreement. And if you look at the typical rich country, they bring in more like 3 percent of the GDP in corporate taxes. Our corporations are some of the most successful ones in the world. If you look at any list of like the world’s top corporations, the U.S. has a dominant place on these lists and it disproportionately so relative to the size of our economy. So it seems particularly odd for us to decide to collect so little corporate tax revenue.', 'bias': 'left'}, 'options': {'1': 'Completely agree', '2': 'Agree', '3': 'Agree to some extent', '4': 'Neither agree nor disagree', '5': 'Disagree to some extent', '6': 'Disagree', '7': 'Completely disagree'}}\n",
